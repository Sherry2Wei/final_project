What is included in a BrokerCheck report?
BrokerCheck reports for individual brokers include information such as employment history, professional
qualifications, disciplinary actions, criminal convictions, civil judgments and arbitration awards. BrokerCheck
reports for brokerage firms include information on a firm’s profile, history, and operations, as well as many of the
same disclosure events mentioned above.
Please note that the information contained in a BrokerCheck report may include pending actions or
allegations that may be contested, unresolved or unproven. In the end, these actions or allegations may be
resolved in favor of the broker or brokerage firm, or concluded through a negotiated settlement with no
admission or finding of wrongdoing.
Where did this information come from?
The information contained in BrokerCheck comes from FINRA’s Central Registration Depository, or
CRD® and is a combination of:
o information FINRA and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) require brokers and
brokerage firms to submit as part of the registration and licensing process, and
o information that regulators report regarding disciplinary actions or allegations against firms or brokers.
How current is this information?
Generally, active brokerage firms and brokers are required to update their professional and disciplinary
information in CRD within 30 days. Under most circumstances, information reported by brokerage firms, brokers
and regulators is available in BrokerCheck the next business day.
What if I want to check the background of an investment adviser firm or investment adviser
representative?
To check the background of an investment adviser firm or representative, you can search for the firm or
individual in BrokerCheck. If your search is successful, click on the link provided to view the available licensing
and registration information in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website at
https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. In the alternative, you may search the IAPD website directly or contact your
state securities regulator at http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/P455414.
Are there other resources I can use to check the background of investment professionals?
FINRA recommends that you learn as much as possible about an investment professional before
deciding to work with them. Your state securities regulator can help you research brokers and investment adviser
representatives doing business in your state.

Disclosure Event Details
What you should know about reported disclosure events:
1. BrokerCheck provides details for any disclosure event that was reported in CRD. It also includes
summary information regarding FINRA arbitration awards in cases where the brokerage firm was
named as a respondent.
2. Certain thresholds must be met before an event is reported to CRD, for example:
o A law enforcement agency must file formal charges before a brokerage firm is required to disclose a
particular criminal event.
3. Disclosure events in BrokerCheck reports come from different sources:
o Disclosure events for this brokerage firm were reported by the firm and/or regulators. When the firm
and a regulator report information for the same event, both versions of the event will appear in the
BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source
labeled.

FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY SYSTEM, INCLUDING

INCLUDE PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE
ACCURACY OF INFORMATION REPORTED. WHILE THE PROCEDURES
PROVIDED FOR COMPARISONS OF DATA IN CURRENT REPORTING TO
DATA IN PRIOR PERIODS, FOR IDENTIFYING OUTLYING DATA IN CURRENT
REPORTS, THE PROCEDURES WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED
INSOFAR AS THEY DID NOT IDENTIFY STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED AND
DOCUMENTED BY THE RESPONSIBLE SUPERVISOR TO RESOLVE
POTENTIAL DATA QUALITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED THROUGH SUCH
COMPARISONS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM'S ERRONEOUS RULE 605 AND 606
REPORTING AND COLLATERAL THE ORDER AUDIT TRAIL SYSTEM (OATS)
MISREPORTING WAS NOT DETECTED PRIOR TO THE FIRM'S SELF-REPORT
AND SUBSEQUENT REMEDIAL EFFORTS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED
THAT THE FIRM MADE AVAILABLE MONTHLY REPORTS ON THE COVERED
ORDERS IN NATIONAL MARKET SYSTEM (NMS) STOCKS THAT IT RECEIVED
FOR EXECUTION FROM ANY PERSON PURSUANT TO RULE 605. THESE
MONTHLY REPORTS, HOWEVER, INCLUDED INCORRECT INFORMATION
DUE TO SEPARATE TECHNOLOGY ISSUES THAT RESULTED IN OMITTED OR
MISCLASSIFIED ORDERS AND OMITTED SHARES. AS A RESULT OF A
VENDOR'S SYSTEM CONFIGURATION ISSUE, THE FIRM MADE AVAILABLE
MONTHLY REPORTS ON THE COVERED ORDERS IN NMS STOCKS THAT IT
RECEIVED FOR EXECUTION FROM ANY PERSON AND THESE REPORTS
INCLUDED INCORRECT INFORMATION AS TO CLASSIFICATION OF MIDPRICE PEG, IMMEDIATE OR CANCEL ORDERS, WHICH WERE
ERRONEOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE LIMIT ORDERS INSTEAD OF
INSIDE-THE-QUOTE LIMIT ORDERS. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT
THE FIRM MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE A QUARTERLY REPORT ON ITS
ROUTING OF NON-DIRECTED ORDERS IN COVERED SECURITIES
PURSUANT TO RULE 606 AND THESE QUARTERLY REPORTS, HOWEVER,
INCLUDED INCORRECT AND INCOMPLETE INFORMATION REGARDING
ROUTING PERCENTAGES DUE TO TECHNOLOGY ISSUES THAT RESULTED
IN THE OMISSION OR MISCLASSIFICATION OF ORDERS IN THE
CALCULATIONS OF ROUTING PERCENTAGES. FINRA FOUND THAT THE
FIRM TRANSMITTED TO THE OATS REPORTS THAT CONTAINED
INACCURATE "NOT HELD" CODES BECAUSE OF A TECHNOLOGY ISSUE
THAT CAUSED CERTAIN "HELD" ORDERS OR CERTAIN IMMEDIATE-ORCANCEL ("IOC") ORDERS TO BE CLASSIFIED ERRONEOUSLY AS "NOT
HELD." THE FIRM FAILED TO TRANSMIT REPORTABLE ORDER EVENTS
(ROES) TO OATS. FINRA ALSO FOUND THAT ON A CERTAIN DATE, THE FIRM
FAILED ON OCCASIONS TO PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTIFICATION DISCLOSING
TO ITS CUSTOMER ITS CORRECT CAPACITY IN THE TRANSACTION AND ON
OCCASIONS WHEN IT ACTED AS PRINCIPAL FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT,
FAILED TO PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTIFICATION DISCLOSING TO ITS
CUSTOMER THAT IT WAS A MARKET MAKER IN EACH SUCH SECURITY. FOR
ALMOST A YEAR, THE FIRM FAILED ON OCCASIONS TO PROVIDE THE
REQUIRED WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OF A TRANSACTION TO ITS

MUTUAL FUNDS TO THE MODEL SELECTED BY THE CUSTOMER, AND THE
CALCULATION OF FEES CHARGED TO WEALTH MANAGEMENT
CUSTOMERS. THE FIRM DISCOVERED THAT THE VENDOR WAS NOT
REBALANCING CERTAIN ACCOUNTS. TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES BY THE
VENDOR CAUSED ACCOUNTS TO NOT BE REBALANCED AT THE
APPROPRIATE TIME. OVER THREE YEARS, 6,411 ACCOUNTS WERE NOT
REBALANCED AS REQUIRED. SIMILARLY, THE VENDOR CONVERTED TO A
NEW BILLING PLATFORM, AND BECAUSE THE FIRM DID NOT CONDUCT
TESTING AFTER TECHNOLOGY CHANGES OR HAVE ANY OTHER
SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES IN PLACE, MULTIPLE BILLING ERRORS WENT
UNDETECTED FOR PERIODS OF SEVERAL MONTHS TO ALMOST THREE
YEARS. BECAUSE THE FIRM FAILED TO MONITOR HOW ITS VENDOR
CALCULATED THESE FEES AND REBATES, APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION
IN ERRONEOUS FEES WERE ASSESSED IN MORE THAN 150,000
ACCOUNTS.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT DURING THE
REVIEW PERIOD, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE FIRM FAILED TO
SIMULTANEOUSLY SEND INTERMARKET SWEEP ORDERS (ISOS) TO
EXECUTE AGAINST THE FULL DISPLAYED SIZE OF CERTAIN PROTECTED
QUOTATIONS, WHICH LED TO TRADE-THROUGHS OF SUCH PROTECTED
QUOTATIONS. THE FIRM ATTRIBUTED THIS TO VARIOUS FLAWS AND
DEFICIENCIES IN ITS SYSTEMS. FROM FEBRUARY 2012 TO MAY 2015, THE
FIRM'S ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DID NOT SEND PROPERLY CODED
ISOS TO A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE WITH A PROTECTED
QUOTATION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE EXCHANGE REJECTED THE ISOS,
RESULTING IN THE FIRM TRADING THROUGH THESE PROTECTED
QUOTATIONS. FROM JULY 2014 TO AUGUST 2015, THE FIRM'S ORDER
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ERRONEOUSLY APPLIED A CUSTOMER
INSTRUCTION FOR A MINIMUM EXECUTION QUANTITY TO ORDERS
ROUTED FOR EXECUTION IN "LIT" TRADING VENUES INSTEAD OF LIMITING
THIS INSTRUCTION TO ORDERS ROUTED FOR EXECUTION IN "DARK"
TRADING VENUES. CONSEQUENTLY, FOR CERTAIN ISOS, THE FIRM DID
NOT, AS REQUIRED BY SEC RULE 611, CREATE ROUTES TO PROTECTED
MARKETS DISPLAYING QUOTES WITH A QUANTITY LESS THAN THE
MINIMUM EXECUTION QUANTITY SPECIFIED IN THE CUSTOMER
INSTRUCTION. DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO RETAIN

FINRA'S OFFICE OF HEARING OFFICERS REVIEWED THE OFFER OF
SETTLEMENT AND CONSENT UNDER THE TERMS OF A REGULATORY
SERVICES AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED) BETWEEN NYSE ARCA INC. AND
THE FIRM.
THE FIRM ENTERED INTO AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT AND CONSENT FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SETTLING THIS DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING,
WITHOUT ADJUDICATION OF ANY ISSUES OF LAW OR FACT, AND WITHOUT
ADMITTING OR DENYING ANY ALLEGATIONS OR FINDINGS REFERRED TO
IN THE OFFER OF SETTLEMENT.
THE HEARING OFFICER ACCEPTS THE OFFER OF SETTLEMENT AND
CONSENT AND ISSUES THIS DECISION. THE FIRM ENGAGED IN CONDUCT
INCONSISTENT WITH JUST AND EQUITABLE PRINCIPLES OF TRADE, IN
THAT, WHILE HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF THE MATERIAL TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF AN ORDER TO BUY PUT OPTIONS, THE FIRM'S TRADER
ENTERED AN ORDER TO BUY THE SECURITY UNDERLYING THE PUT
OPTIONS.
THE FINDINGS STATED THE FIRM'S TRADER, BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A FACILITATION ORDER, EFFECTED
TRANSACTIONS AS HEDGES AGAINST AN ORDER TO BUY PUT OPTIONS
PRIOR TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ORDER BEING
DISCLOSED. SPECIFICALLY, THE FIRM TRADER RECEIVED A CLIENT
ORDER TO SELL 1,000 PUT OPTIONS OF A CERTAIN EXCHANGE-TRADED
FUND. THE FIRM TRADER THEN ENTERED AN INTER-MARKET SWEEP
ORDER ("ISO") TO HEDGE THE FIRM'S PURCHASE OF PUT OPTIONS AND
BOUGHT 29,800 SHARES OF THE FUND. AFTER BUYING THE 29,800
SHARES, THE FIRM TRADER BOUGHT 1,000 PUT OPTIONS OF THE FUND IN
ORDER TO FACILITATE THE CLIENT ORDER. THE FIRM TRADER
IMPROPERLY HEDGED THE THEN-UNDISCLOSED FACILITATION ORDER
WHEN HE PURCHASED THE 29,800 SHARES AS A HEDGE PRIOR TO
PURCHASING THE 1,000 PUT OPTIONS.

TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT DURING A
CODE-SPLIT, THAT THE FIRM UNDERTOOK TO CREATE SEPARATE ORDER
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (OMS) FOR ITS INSTITUTIONAL CASH CLIENTS
AND FOR ITS RETAIL CLIENTS, THE FIRM FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
HISTORICAL FILTERS IN ITS PRIOR OMS WHICH RESULTED IN THE OVERADVERTISEMENT OF TRADE VOLUME. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT AS A
RESULT, FAILING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE HISTORICAL FILTERS,
ERRONEOUSLY CAPTURED VOLUME THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN
ADVERTISED ON A TRADE DATE WHEN IT LATER SWEPT FOR VOLUME
THAT WAS DELAYED FOR ADVERTISING, BASED ON CLIENT PREFERENCE,
ON TRADE DATE PLUS THREE (T+3). THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT
THE FIRM'S PRIOR SYSTEM ALSO DID NOT FILTER OUT REPLICATED
PARENT-CHILD ORDER VOLUME. AS A RESULT, AN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT
TRADE THAT WAS ADVERTISED APPROPRIATELY ON A PARTICULAR TRADE
DATE WOULD BE SUBMITTED AGAIN FOR ADVERTISEMENT, AND IN THE
CASE OF SOME PARENT-CHILD ORDERS, MORE THAN ONCE, ON A T+3
BASIS. AS ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS WERE MOVED TO THE
NEW OMS, A PROCESS THAT OCCURRED OVER A FOUR-MONTH PERIOD,
THE IMPACT OF THE OVER-ADVERTISED T+3 VOLUME INCREASED.
EXTRAPOLATING FROM THE VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY FINRA INDICATED
THAT THE FIRM LIKELY OVERSTATED ITS ADVERTISED TRADE VOLUME BY
BILLIONS OF SHARES THROUGH BLOOMBERG AND AUTEX. ULTIMATELY,
THE FIRM VOLUNTARILY REMOVED BILLIONS OF SHARES THAT IT
ADVERTISED, INCLUDING ADVERTISEMENTS RELATED TO ACTUAL
EXECUTIONS, BUT NOT UNTIL AFTER THE RELEVANT TRADE DATES. THE
FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO CONDUCTED
REVIEWS OF THE ACCURACY OF ADVERTISED TRADE VOLUME DID NOT
HAVE ACCESS TO FIRM-WIDE EXECUTION VOLUME BECAUSE OF
INFORMATION BARRIERS. FIRM-WIDE EXECUTION VOLUME WAS NOT
READILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE INDIVIDUALS CONDUCTING REVIEWS OF
THE ACCURACY OF ADVERTISED TRADE VOLUME. THIS INHIBITED THE
FIRM'S ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY KNOW THE TRADE VOLUME FOR ANY
SECURITY TO ENSURE ANY ADVERTISEMENT OF SUCH VOLUME WAS
ACCURATE. THE FIRM ALSO FAILED TO HAVE ANY SUPERVISORY SYSTEM,
INCLUDING WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS), IN PLACE TO
REVIEW THE ACCURACY OF TRADE VOLUME ADVERTISED ON A T+3 BASIS.
THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY DEFICIENCIES ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE
FIRM'S ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY REVIEW THE ACCURACY OF ITS TRADE
VOLUME ADVERTISEMENTS.

CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED
TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS BY REJECTING
ORDERS THAT EXCEED APPROPRIATE PRICE OR SIZE PARAMETERS, OR
THAT INDICATE DUPLICATIVE ORDERS.
DESPITE THE VARIOUS PRE-TRADE CONTROLS AND FILTERS DESIGNED
TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS THAT THE FIRM HAD IN
PLACE DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO IMPLEMENT
REASONABLY DESIGNED PRE-TRADE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS
APPLICABLE TO ORDERS SUBMITTED BY CERTAIN MARKET ACCESS
CLIENTS AND CERTAIN FIRM TRADERS, AND FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND
IMPLEMENT SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
PREVENT THE ENTRY OF CERTAIN ERRONEOUS ORDERS DURING THE
REVIEW PERIOD.
BECAUSE THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE CONTROLS WERE NOT REASONABLY
DESIGNED AS APPLIED TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S MARKET ACCESS
CLIENTS AND TRADERS, THE FIRM DID NOT PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION
OF CERTAIN ERRONEOUS EQUITY ORDERS TO THE RELEVANT SROS AND
TO THE EXCHANGE, CAUSING 14 ERRONEOUS ORDER EVENTS

THE SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS (SROS) AND THE EXCHANGE,
THREE VOLATILITY TRADING PAUSES ("VTPS") AND ONE REQUEST FOR A
VOLUNTARY BUST (INVOLVING 77 TRADES). THESE ORDERS CAUSED
PRICE MOVEMENT IN THE RELATED SECURITIES OF BETWEEN 10

FURTHER, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE CONTROLS
THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A
SECURITY, SUCH AS THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADE VOLUME (ADTV) OF A
SECURITY. IN ADDITION, A CONTROL APPLICABLE TO LIMIT ORDERS FOR
AT LEAST ONE MARKET ACCESS CLIENT, CALLED THE "OUT OF
RANGE/PRICE CHECK" CONTROL, HAD A GENERALLY APPLICABLE PRICE
CHECK THAT WAS SET AT A PARTICULAR PERCENTAGE AWAY FROM THE
LAST SALE OR THE PREVIOUS DAY'S CLOSE OR THE AVERAGE OF THE
NATIONAL BEST BID OR OFFER ("NBBO"), WHICH WAS TOO HIGH TO
PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS ENTERED DURING PREMARKET TRADING HOURS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL REASONABLE
CONTROLS. IN AT LEAST TWO INSTANCES, THE FIRM'S CONTROLS WERE
NOT APPLIED BECAUSE, AS DESIGNED, THE CONTROLS DID NOT APPLY TO
ORDERS THAT HAD BEEN AMENDED OR MODIFIED.

THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM USED A SERIES OF POSTTRADE SURVEILLANCE REPORTS RUN BY A COMMERCIAL NONPROPRIETARY THIRD-PARTY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ("THIRD-PARTY
SURVEILLANCE 'SYSTEM") TO MONITOR AND REVIEW CUSTOMER
TRADING ACTIVITY TO DETECT, ESCALATE AND ULTIMATELY PREVENT
POTENTIALLY VIOLATIVE OR MANIPULATIVE TRADING ACTIVITY,
INCLUDING LAYERING AND SPOOFING. PURSUANT TO THE PARAMETERS
IN THE THIRD-PARTY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM UTILIZED BY THE FIRM,
SEVERAL THRESHOLDS MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO GENERATE LAYERING
AND SPOOFING ALERTS ON THE FIRM'S EXCEPTION REPORTS. CERTAIN
OF THESE THRESHOLDS, HOWEVER, WERE SET AT LEVELS THAT WERE
UNREASONABLE TO DETECT ACTIVITY THAT MAY BE INDICATIVE OF
LAYERING AND SPOOFING ACTIVITY. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM FAILED TO
ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE CERTAIN OF ITS CUSTOMERS' TRADING AND
FAILED TO DETECT POTENTIALLY VIOLATIVE SPOOFING ACTIVITY THAT
OCCURRED ON SEVERAL DAYS ON THE EXCHANGE.

User Guidance

DESPITE THE VARIOUS PRE-TRADE CONTROLS AND FILTERS DESIGNED
TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS THAT THE FIRM HAD IN
PLACE DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO IMPLEMENT
REASONABLY DESIGNED PRE-TRADE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS
APPLICABLE TO ORDERS SUBMITTED BY CERTAIN MARKET ACCESS
CLIENTS AND CERTAIN FIRM TRADERS, AND FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND
IMPLEMENT SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
PREVENT THE ENTRY OF CERTAIN ERRONEOUS ORDERS DURING THE
REVIEW PERIOD.
BECAUSE THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE CONTROLS WERE NOT REASONABLY
DESIGNED AS APPLIED TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S MARKET ACCESS
CLIENTS AND TRADERS, THE FIRM DID NOT PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION
OF CERTAIN ERRONEOUS EQUITY ORDERS TO THE RELEVANT SROS AND
TO THE EXCHANGE, CAUSING 14 ERRONEOUS ORDER EVENTS
RESULTING IN CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EXECUTION ("CEE") FILINGS WITH
THE SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS (SROS) AND THE EXCHANGE,
THREE VOLATILITY TRADING PAUSES ("VTPS") AND ONE REQUEST FOR A
VOLUNTARY BUST (INVOLVING 77 TRADES). THESE ORDERS CAUSED
PRICE MOVEMENT IN THE RELATED SECURITIES OF BETWEEN 10
PERCENT AND 188 PERCENT.
THERE WERE SEVERAL PRIMARY DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S PRETRADE PRICE AND SIZE CONTROLS THAT RESULTED IN THE SUBMISSION
OF THE ORDERS THAT CAUSED THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CEE FILINGS.
FURTHER, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE CONTROLS
THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A
SECURITY, SUCH AS THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADE VOLUME (ADTV) OF A
SECURITY.
IN ADDITION, A CONTROL APPLICABLE TO LIMIT ORDERS FOR AT LEAST
ONE MARKET ACCESS CLIENT, CALLED THE "OUT OF RANGE/PRICE
CHECK" CONTROL, HAD A GENERALLY APPLICABLE PRICE CHECK THAT
WAS SET AT A PARTICULAR PERCENTAGE AWAY FROM THE LAST SALE OR
THE PREVIOUS DAY'S CLOSE OR THE AVERAGE OF THE NATIONAL BEST
BID OR OFFER ("NBBO"), WHICH WAS TOO HIGH TO PREVENT THE ENTRY
OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS ENTERED DURING PRE-MARKET TRADING
HOURS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL REASONABLE CONTROLS. IN AT LEAST TWO
INSTANCES, THE FIRM'S CONTROLS WERE NOT APPLIED BECAUSE, AS
DESIGNED, THE CONTROLS DID NOT APPLY TO ORDERS THAT HAD BEEN
AMENDED OR MODIFIED.
THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO HAVE
REASONABLY DESIGNED RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS TO DETECT
INSTANCES WHEN ALGORITHMS USED BY ITS MARKET ACCESS CLIENTS
EXPERIENCED CANCEL-REPLACE AND BUY-SELL LOOPING OF ORDERS ON
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, WHICH CAUSED HIGH LEVELS OF MESSAGE
TRAFFIC ON THE SROS.

Regulator Statement

(CONT. FROM THE ALLEGATIONS SECTION) FURTHERMORE, THE HARD-BLOCKS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FIRM WERE
ALSO SET AT LEVELS THAT WERE TOO HIGH AND REQUIRED ACTIVITY TO
PERSIST FOR TOO LONG IN ORDER TO POTENTIALLY IDENTIFY AND
PREVENT THE ENTRY OF A HIGH VOLUME OF UNINTENDED ORDERS OR
MESSAGES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM'S METHOD FOR DETERMINING
APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS FOR MESSAGING ALERTS AND HARDBLOCKS WAS NOT REASONABLE AS IT WAS SOLELY BASED ON A MULTIPLE
OF A MARKET ACCESS CLIENT'S PEAK MESSAGING ACTIVITY AND DID NOT
ALSO FACTOR IN OTHER INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A CLIENT'S
ORDER FLOW.
LASTLY, WHILE THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF ALERTS FOR A
HIGH VOLUME OF ORDERS OR MESSAGES ON A POST-TRADE BASIS TO
DETERMINE WHETHER THE ACTIVITY COULD BE INDICATIVE OF A
MANIPULATIVE TRADING STRATEGY, THE SURVEILLANCES USED FOR THIS
PURPOSE WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO BE EFFECTIVE, AS
CERTAIN SURVEILLANCE PARAMETERS WERE SET TOO HIGH AND
REQUIRE THE ACTIVITY TO PERSIST TOO LONG, TO GENERATE AN ALERT
GIVEN ALL FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM USED A SERIES OF POSTTRADE SURVEILLANCE REPORTS RUN BY A COMMERCIAL NONPROPRIETARY THIRD-PARTY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ("THIRD-PARTY
SURVEILLANCE 'SYSTEM") TO MONITOR AND REVIEW CUSTOMER
TRADING ACTIVITY TO DETECT, ESCALATE AND ULTIMATELY PREVENT
POTENTIALLY VIOLATIVE OR MANIPULATIVE TRADING ACTIVITY,
INCLUDING LAYERING AND SPOOFING. PURSUANT TO THE PARAMETERS
IN THE THIRD-PARTY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM UTILIZED BY THE FIRM,
SEVERAL THRESHOLDS MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO GENERATE LAYERING
AND SPOOFING ALERTS ON THE FIRM'S EXCEPTION REPORTS. CERTAIN
OF THESE THRESHOLDS, HOWEVER, WERE SET AT LEVELS THAT WERE
UNREASONABLE TO DETECT ACTIVITY THAT MAY BE INDICATIVE OF
LAYERING AND SPOOFING ACTIVITY. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM FAILED TO

Regulator Statement

THE DECISION OF THE BUSINESS CONDUCT COMMITTEE ("COMMITTEE")
OF NASDAQ PHLX LLC (THE "EXCHANGE") IN THE MATTER IS AS FOLLOWS:
THE FIRM MADE AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT, STIPULATION OF FACTS AND
CONSENT TO SANCTIONS.
RESPONDENT STIPULATES TO THE FACTS, CONSENTS TO THE
CONCLUSION OF VIOLATIONS OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE
EXCHANGE RULES AND FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, AND CONSENTS TO
THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING, WITHOUT
ADMITTING OR DENYING THE ALLEGATIONS OR CONCLUSIONS IN THE
STATEMENT OF CHARGES.
RESPONDENT AGREES THAT THE DECISION TO BE ISSUED SHALL BE
FINAL, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A REVIEW OF THE DECISION OR ANY
OTHER PHASE OR ASPECT OF THIS PROCEEDING BY THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF THE EXCHANGE; BY THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION; BY ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT; OR IN ANY OTHER
FORUM OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS.
THE COMMITTEE ACCEPTS THE FOREGOING STIPULATION OF FACTS AND
ON THE BASIS THEREOF FINDS THAT RESPONDENT VIOLATED
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT RULE 15C3-5(B) AND (C)(1)(II) AND EXCHANGE
RULE 748.
THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THE SANCTIONS PROPOSED BY
RESPONDENT IN ITS OFFER SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST, ARE
SUFFICIENTLY REMEDIAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND REPRESENT
A PROPER DISCHARGE OF THE EXCHANGE'S REGULATORY
RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.
IF RESPONDENT FAILS TO PAY THE FINE WITHIN 30 CALENDAR DAYS OF
THE DATE OF THIS DECISION, OR FAILS TO COMPLY WITH ANY OTHER
SANCTION BY THE DATE SET FORTH HEREIN, THE COMMITTEE SHALL
DECLARE RESPONDENT TO BE IN MATERIAL BREACH OF ITS AGREEMENT
AND MAY TAKE WHATEVER ACTIONS IT DEEMS NECESSARY TO RESPOND
TO THE BREACH, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RESCINDING THIS
DECISION AND ALLOWING THE MATTER TO PROCEED IN ACCORDANCE

Allegations:

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
ESTABLISH, DOCUMENT, AND MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING WRITTEN
SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF FOLLOW-UP
AND REVIEW, REASONABLY DESIGNED TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL,
REGULATORY, AND OTHER RISKS OF ITS MARKET ACCESS BUSINESS.
THE FINDINGS STATED THAT SPECIFICALLY, THE FIRM FAILED TO
ESTABLISH, DOCUMENT, AND MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED
TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS BY REJECTING
ORDERS THAT EXCEED APPROPRIATE PRICE OR SIZE PARAMETERS, OR
THAT INDICATE DUPLICATIVE ORDERS.

DESPITE THE VARIOUS PRE-TRADE CONTROLS AND FILTERS DESIGNED
TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS THAT THE FIRM HAD IN
PLACE DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO IMPLEMENT
REASONABLY DESIGNED PRE-TRADE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS
APPLICABLE TO ORDERS SUBMITTED BY CERTAIN MARKET ACCESS
CLIENTS AND CERTAIN FIRM TRADERS, AND FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND
IMPLEMENT SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
PREVENT THE ENTRY OF CERTAIN ERRONEOUS ORDERS DURING THE
REVIEW PERIOD.
BECAUSE THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE CONTROLS WERE NOT REASONABLY
DESIGNED AS APPLIED TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S MARKET ACCESS
CLIENTS AND TRADERS, THE FIRM DID NOT PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION
OF CERTAIN ERRONEOUS EQUITY ORDERS TO THE SROS AND TO THE
EXCHANGE, CAUSING 14 ERRONEOUS ORDER EVENTS RESULTING IN
CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EXECUTION ("CEE") FILINGS WITH THE SELFREGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS (SROS) AND THE EXCHANGE, THREE
VOLATILITY TRADING PAUSES ("VTPS") AND ONE REQUEST FOR A
VOLUNTARY BUST (INVOLVING 77 TRADES). THESE ORDERS CAUSED
PRICE MOVEMENT IN THE RELATED SECURITIES OF BETWEEN 10
PERCENT AND 188 PERCENT.
THERE WERE SEVERAL PRIMARY DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S PRETRADE PRICE AND SIZE CONTROLS THAT RESULTED IN THE SUBMISSION
OF THE ORDERS THAT CAUSED THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CEE FILINGS.
FURTHER, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE CONTROLS
THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A
SECURITY, SUCH AS THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADE VOLUME (ADTV) OF A
SECURITY.

FURTHER, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE CONTROLS
THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A
SECURITY, SUCH AS THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADE VOLUME (ADTV) OF A

IN ADDITION, A CONTROL APPLICABLE TO LIMIT ORDERS FOR AT LEAST
ONE MARKET ACCESS CLIENT, CALLED THE "OUT OF RANGE/PRICE
CHECK" CONTROL, HAD A GENERALLY APPLICABLE PRICE CHECK THAT
WAS SET AT A PARTICULAR PERCENTAGE AWAY FROM THE LAST SALE OR
THE PREVIOUS DAY'S CLOSE OR THE AVERAGE OF THE NATIONAL BEST
BID OR OFFER ("NBBO"), WHICH WAS TOO HIGH TO PREVENT THE ENTRY
OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS ENTERED DURING PRE-MARKET TRADING
HOURS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL REASONABLE CONTROLS. IN AT LEAST TWO
INSTANCES, THE FIRM'S CONTROLS WERE NOT APPLIED BECAUSE, AS
DESIGNED, THE CONTROLS DID NOT APPLY TO ORDERS THAT HAD BEEN
AMENDED OR MODIFIED.

THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM USED A SERIES OF POSTTRADE SURVEILLANCE REPORTS RUN BY A COMMERCIAL NONPROPRIETARY THIRD-PARTY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ("THIRD-PARTY
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM") TO MONITOR AND REVIEW CUSTOMER TRADING
ACTIVITY TO DETECT, ESCALATE AND ULTIMATELY PREVENT POTENTIALLY
VIOLATIVE OR MANIPULATIVE TRADING ACTIVITY, INCLUDING LAYERING
AND SPOOFING. PURSUANT TO THE PARAMETERS IN THE THIRD-PARTY
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM UTILIZED BY THE FIRM, SEVERAL THRESHOLDS
MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO GENERATE LAYERING AND SPOOFING ALERTS
ON THE FIRM'S EXCEPTION REPORTS. CERTAIN OF THESE THRESHOLDS,
HOWEVER, WERE SET AT LEVELS THAT WERE UNREASONABLE TO
DETECT ACTIVITY THAT MAY BE INDICATIVE OF LAYERING AND SPOOFING
ACTIVITY. AS A RESULT THE FIRM FAILED TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE
CERTAIN OF ITS CUSTOMERS' TRADING, AND FAILED TO DETECT
POTENTIALLY VIOLATIVE LAYERING ACTIVITY THAT OCCURRED ON AT
LEAST THREE DAYS ON THE EXCHANGE IN JULY 2015.

Regulator Statement

(CONT. FROM THE ALLEGATIONS SECTION)-

FURTHER, THE FIRM'S DUPLICATE ORDER CONTROL DURING THE REVIEW
PERIOD ONLY REJECTED ORDERS THAT WERE SUBMITTED UNDER
IDENTICAL ORDER IDENTIFICATIONS DURING A MARKET ACCESS CLIENT'S
TRADING SESSION.
MOREOVER, PRIOR TO JANUARY 2014, THE FIRM EMPLOYED SOFT-BLOCK
ALERTS FOR ORDER OR MESSAGE ACTIVITY, RATHER THAN ANY HARDBLOCKS, THAT COULD BE OVERRIDDEN, AND THE LEVELS SET FOR THE
ALERTS WERE TOO HIGH TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY UNINTENDED
MESSAGING ACTIVITY.

FURTHERMORE, THE HARD-BLOCKS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FIRM WERE
ALSO SET AT LEVELS THAT WERE TOO HIGH AND REQUIRED ACTIVITY TO
PERSIST FOR TOO LONG IN ORDER TO POTENTIALLY IDENTIFY AND
PREVENT THE ENTRY OF A HIGH VOLUME OF UNINTENDED ORDERS OR
MESSAGES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM'S METHOD FOR DETERMINING
APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS FOR MESSAGING ALERTS AND HARDBLOCKS WAS NOT REASONABLE AS IT WAS SOLELY BASED ON A MULTIPLE
OF A MARKET ACCESS CLIENT'S PEAK MESSAGING ACTIVITY AND DID NOT
ALSO FACTOR IN OTHER INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A CLIENT'S
ORDER FLOW.
LASTLY, WHILE THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF ALERTS FOR A
HIGH VOLUME OF ORDERS OR MESSAGES ON A POST-TRADE BASIS TO
DETERMINE WHETHER THE ACTIVITY COULD BE INDICATIVE OF A
MANIPULATIVE TRADING STRATEGY, THE SURVEILLANCES USED FOR THIS
PURPOSE WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO BE EFFECTIVE, AS
CERTAIN SURVEILLANCE PARAMETERS WERE SET TOO HIGH AND
REQUIRE THE ACTIVITY TO PERSIST TOO LONG, TO GENERATE AN ALERT

CFTC PRESS RELEASE: PR7511-17, JANUARY 11, 2017:
THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION ("COMMISSION") HAS
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC ("JPMS" OR
"RESPONDENT") HAS VIOLATED COMMISSION REGULATION 166.3, 17
C.F.R. § 166.3 (2015). THEREFORE, THE COMMISSION DEEMS IT
APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED TO
DETERMINE WHETHER JPMS HAS ENGAGED IN THE VIOLATIONS AS SET
FORTH HEREIN AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY ORDER SHOULD BE
ISSUED IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS.
THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT DURING THE PERIOD 2010 TO 2014
("RELEVANT PERIOD"), JPMS FAILED TO DILIGENTLY SUPERVISE ITS
OFFICERS', EMPLOYEES', AND AGENTS' PROCESSING OF EXCHANGE AND
CLEARING FEES ("EXCHANGE FEES") INVOICED TO JPMS BY EXCHANGES
AND CHARGED BY JPMS TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN CONNECTION WITH
FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS, IN VIOLATION OF REGULATION
166.3, 17 C.F.R. § 166.3 (2015).
JPMS FAILED TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SYSTEMS FOR
RECONCILING INVOICES FROM EXCHANGE CLEARINGHOUSES WITH THE
AMOUNTS OF FEES ACTUALLY CHARGED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. JPMS' FEE
RECONCILIATION PROCESS WAS LARGELY MANUAL AND CARRIED OUT BY
ONLY ONE EMPLOYEE AT THE END OF THE MONTH USING THREE
DIFFERENT JPMS SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION TO INSUFFICIENT STAFF TO
COMPLETE THE FEE RECONCILIATION PROCESS ACCURATELY, JPMS DID
NOT HAVE ADEQUATE WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE
REGARDING ITS CLEARING AND EXCHANGE FEE RECONCILIATIONS.
ACCORDINGLY, THIS LED TO INSTANCES IN WHICH JPMS OVERCHARGED
SOME CUSTOMERS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $7.8
MILLION. JPMS DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM IN 2014, SELF-REPORTED IT
TO THE CFTC, AND THEREAFTER TOOK REMEDIAL STEPS, INCLUDING
REFUNDING ADVERSELY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS.

FINRA DETERMINED THAT THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLED ORDERS FROM
THE ORIGINAL SUBMISSIONS WERE MISSING DETAIL OR CONTAINED DATA

www.finra.org/brokercheck

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
RECONCILE AND ACCURATELY CAPTURE BOOKS AND RECORDS DATA
ACROSS MULTIPLE DATA SYSTEMS AND PAPER TICKETS. THE FINDINGS
STATED THAT FINRA'S EXAMINATIONS FOUND THAT THOUSANDS OF
ORDER TICKETS HANDLED MANUALLY BY THE FIRM CONTAINED SOME
COMBINATION OF INCORRECT OR MISSING DATA IN VIOLATION OF
EXCHANGE ACT RULE 17A-3. SPECIFICALLY, THE DEFICIENT DATA
RESULTED FROM FLAWS IN DATA CAPTURE, SUCH AS SALES TRADERS
NEGLECTING TO RECORD ORDER RECEIPT TIMES, SYSTEMS/TICKETS
REFLECTING RECEIPT TIMES CONFLICTING WITH EXCHANGE DATA, OR
TRADERS NEGLECTING TO RECORD CORRECT TRANSMISSION TIMES IN
ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS VIA BROKER TRANSMISSION
TIMESTAMPS. WITH RESPECT TO CONDITIONS OF ORDERS, THERE DID
NOT APPEAR TO BE A VEHICLE DURING AT LEAST PART OF THE REVIEW
PERIOD FOR THE FIRM TO ELECTRONICALLY IDENTIFY ORDERS AS
SPREADS. AS TO MODIFICATIONS, PAPER TICKETS DID NOT ALWAYS
SHOW MODIFICATIONS, EVEN IF THE FIRM'S DATABASES DID. THE FLAWS
IN DATA CAPTURE IMPACTED THOUSANDS OF OPTIONS ORDER TICKETS
HANDLED BY THE FIRM, PRIMARILY DURING 2012-2013. THE
EXAMINATIONS FURTHER SHOWED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO STORE
BOOKS AND RECORDS IN AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE PLACE AS REQUIRED BY
EXCHANGE ACT RULE 17A-4. OVER THE COURSE OF THE EXAMINATIONS,
THE FIRM WAS ONLY ABLE TO PRODUCE TICKETS IN A PIECEMEAL
FASHION. THE FIRM MAINTAINED A CENTRALIZED DATA REPOSITORY
FROM WHICH IT WAS INITIALLY ABLE TO PRODUCE CERTAIN BUT NOT ALL
REQUIRED ORDER DETAILS. AFTER FINRA FOUND SIGNIFICANT
DEFICIENCIES IN THE DATA PROVIDED, THE FIRM SUPPLEMENTED ITS
RESPONSES WITH FURTHER DATA FROM ADDITIONAL SOURCES.
HOWEVER, THIS DATA OFTEN CONFLICTED WITH ORIGINALLY PRODUCED
ORDER DETAILS AND EXCHANGE DATA. MOREOVER, IT OFTEN TOOK THE
FIRM MONTHS AND MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO COMPLETE THE ORDER
TICKET DETAILS FOR SAMPLED ORDERS. IN REVIEWING THE FIRM'S
ORIGINAL RESPONSES TO FINRA ORDER DETAILS REQUESTS, FINRA
DETERMINED THAT THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLED ORDERS FROM THE
ORIGINAL SUBMISSIONS WERE MISSING DETAIL OR CONTAINED DATA
THAT CONFLICTED WITH DATA SUBSEQUENTLY SUBMITTED BY THE FIRM
AFTER A LABOR INTENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING PROCESS. THE
FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM'S WSPS INCLUDED SUPERVISORY
REVIEWS THAT WERE INADEQUATELY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE
ACCURACY OF ITS MANUAL OPTIONS ORDER TICKETS. ADDITIONALLY,
THE FIRM FAILED TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE A SYSTEM REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO SUPERVISE THE OPERATIONS OF ITS BUSINESS AND
ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS
AND NASDAQ OPTIONS MARKET (NOM) RULES PERTAINING TO BOOKS
AND RECORDS FOR MANUAL OPTIONS ORDERS. THE FINDINGS ALSO

IDENTIFY ORDERS AS SPREADS. AS TO MODIFICATIONS, PAPER TICKETS
DID NOT ALWAYS SHOW MODIFICATIONS, EVEN IF THE FIRM'S DATABASES
DID. THE FLAWS IN DATA CAPTURE IMPACTED THOUSANDS OF OPTIONS
ORDER TICKETS HANDLED BY THE FIRM DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD.
THE EXAMINATIONS FURTHER SHOWED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO STORE
BOOKS AND RECORDS IN AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE PLACE AS REQUIRED BY
EXCHANGE ACT RULE 17A-4. THE FIRM WAS ONLY ABLE TO PRODUCE
TICKETS IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION. THE FIRM MAINTAINED A CENTRALIZED
DATA REPOSITORY FROM WHICH IT WAS INITIALLY ABLE TO PRODUCE
CERTAIN BUT NOT ALL REQUIRED ORDER DETAILS. AFTER FINRA FOUND
SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN THE DATA PROVIDED, THE FIRM
SUPPLEMENTED ITS RESPONSES WITH FURTHER DATA FROM ADDITIONAL
SOURCES. HOWEVER, THIS DATA OFTEN CONFLICTED WITH ORIGINALLY
PRODUCED ORDER DETAILS AND EXCHANGE DATA. MOREOVER, IT OFTEN
TOOK THE FIRM MONTHS AND MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO COMPLETE THE
ORDER TICKET DETAILS FOR SAMPLED ORDERS. IN REVIEWING THE
FIRM'S ORIGINAL RESPONSES TO FINRA ORDER DETAILS REQUESTS,
FINRA DETERMINED THAT THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLED ORDERS FROM
THE ORIGINAL SUBMISSIONS WERE MISSING DETAIL OR CONTAINED DATA
THAT CONFLICTED WITH DATA SUBSEQUENTLY SUBMITTED BY THE FIRM
AFTER A LABOR INTENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING PROCESS.
THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM'S WSPS INCLUDED SUPERVISORY
REVIEWS THAT WERE INADEQUATELY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE
ACCURACY OF ITS MANUAL OPTIONS ORDER TICKETS. ADDITIONALLY,
THE FIRM FAILED TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE A SYSTEM REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO SUPERVISE THE OPERATIONS OF ITS BUSINESS AND
ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS
AND NYSE MKT RULES PERTAINING TO BOOKS AND RECORDS FOR
MANUAL OPTIONS ORDERS.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, J.P. MORGAN
SECURITIES LLC (JPMS) CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE
ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO SEND LETTERS TO A TOTAL OF
3,266 GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS
CONFIRMING CHANGES IN THEIR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES WITHIN 30
DAYS OF THE CHANGE, AS REQUIRED UNDER SEC RULES. THE FINDINGS
STATED THAT PREVIOUSLY, WHEN CUSTOMERS NOTIFIED JPMS OF
CHANGES TO THEIR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, THE FIRM UPLOADED
THAT INFORMATION INTO ITS SYSTEMS, BUT CERTAIN INVESTMENT
OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS WERE MANUALLY PREPARED AND
TRANSMITTED. STATED DIFFERENTLY, WHILE THE INFORMATION
CONCERNING THE CHANGES WAS INPUT TO ITS SYSTEMS, JPMS FAILED
TO ENSURE THAT IT MET ITS OBLIGATION TO CONFIRM THE INFORMATION
WITH ITS CLIENTS IN WRITING. THOUGH JPMS HAD IN PLACE A SYSTEM TO
GENERATE AUTOMATED INTERNAL ALERTS PROMPTING THE NEED FOR
SENDING AN INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CONFIRMATION, AS REQUIRED
UNDER SEC RULES, IT FAILED TO REASONABLY ENFORCE ITS SYSTEM
AND, AS A RESULT, FAILED TO SEND AND RETAIN THE REQUIRED
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS. IT DISCOVERED THE FAILURE
WHILE UPDATING CERTAIN SYSTEMS AND SUBSEQUENTLY SENT THE
REQUIRED INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS TO AFFECTED
ACCOUNT HOLDERS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT IT FAILED TO
COLLECT AND REVIEW CERTAIN OUTSIDE BROKERAGE STATEMENTS
ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS. JPMS DISCOVERED THAT IT
DID NOT HAVE - AND THEREFORE HAD NOT REVIEWED - AS MANY AS
12,456 OUTSIDE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT STATEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH
1,929 EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS DURING AN 11-MONTH PERIOD. IT
DISCOVERED THIS FAILURE WHILE IT WAS IN THE PROCESS OF
ENHANCING ITS INTERNAL SYSTEM FOR TRACKING AND RECORDING
SUCH OUTSIDE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT STATEMENTS FOR REVIEW.
FOLLOWING A LOOK-BACK REVIEW, IT DISCOVERED SEVEN INSTANCES
WHERE EMPLOYEES VIOLATED THE FIRM'S POLICY REQUIRING PRECLEARANCE OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING EXCHANGE-TRADED
FUNDS. ALTHOUGH IT HAD SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES IN
PLACE TO TRACK AND REVIEW EMPLOYEES' OUTSIDE BROKERAGE
ACCOUNTS, THOSE SYSTEMS WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
TRACK AND RECORD OUTSIDE BROKERAGE STATEMENTS FOR REVIEW.
THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT JPMS FAILED TO SEND LETTERS
PROVIDING A COPY OF THE ACCOUNT RECORD TO 1,310 NEW PRIVATE
BANK ACCOUNT HOLDERS WITHIN 30 DAYS OF ACCOUNT OPENING.

ACCOUNTS, THOSE SYSTEMS WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO

THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT JPMS FAILED TO SEND LETTERS
PROVIDING A COPY OF THE ACCOUNT RECORD TO 1,310 NEW PRIVATE
BANK ACCOUNT HOLDERS WITHIN 30 DAYS OF ACCOUNT OPENING.
THOUGH IT HAD SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE
CONCERNING THESE 30-DAY LETTERS, THOSE SYSTEMS AND
PROCEDURES WERE DEFICIENT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT ENSURE THAT
SUCH LETTERS WERE PREPARED AND SENT, AND THAT COPIES WERE
PRESERVED. FINRA FOUND THAT JPMS FAILED TO PROVIDE
TRANSACTION CONFIRMATIONS TO 7,298 PRIVATE BANK ACCOUNTS
CONCERNING 92,563 TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT OF ITS FAILURE TO
DELIVER THESE TRANSACTION CONFIRMATIONS, IT ALSO FAILED TO MAKE
AND PRESERVE RECORDS OF SUCH DOCUMENTS. JPMS'S DEFAULT
SETTING FOR TRANSACTION-CONFIRMATION DELIVERY FOR CERTAIN
TYPES OF SELF-DIRECTED FOREIGN FIXED-INCOME TRANSACTIONS BY
CERTAIN PRIVATE BANK CUSTOMERS WAS BY FAX. BUT FOR SOME
PRIVATE BANK CUSTOMERS, JPMS'S CUSTOMER PROFILE SYSTEM
INCORRECTLY CONTAINED AN INTERNAL JPMS OPERATIONS FAX
NUMBER, RESULTING IN A FAILURE TO DELIVER THE CONFIRMATION TO
THE CORRECT LOCATION. JPMS'S SYSTEM FOR GENERATING AND
RECONCILING ACCOUNT STATEMENTS FOR PRIVATE BANK CUSTOMERS
WAS NOT FULLY AUTOMATED AND IT USED THESE FAXED TRANSACTION
CONFIRMATIONS AS PART OF THAT PROCESS. THOUGH JPMS HAD
SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE CONCERNING
DELIVERY OF THE REQUIRED TRANSACTION CONFIRMATIONS, THOSE
SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES WERE DEFICIENT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT
ENSURE THAT SUCH CONFIRMATIONS WERE PREPARED AND SENT, AND
THAT COPIES WERE PRESERVED. JPMS DISCOVERED THE ISSUE.
SUBSEQUENT TESTING CONFIRMED THAT THE TRANSACTIONS AT ISSUE
APPEARED ON CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS. JPMS HAS RECEIVED
NO CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS REGARDING THOSE TRANSACTIONS BY ANY
OF THE AFFECTED PRIVATE BANK CUSTOMERS. (CONTINUE IN THE

Regulator Statement

FINRA ALSO FOUND THAT WHEN CERTAIN JPMS PRIVATE CLIENT
SERVICES CUSTOMERS UPDATED THEIR INVESTOR PROFILES, JPMS
RETAINED THAT INFORMATION IN ITS SYSTEMS AND SENT UPDATING
LETTERS TO THOSE CUSTOMERS, BUT IT DID NOT KEEP COPIES OF
THOSE LETTERS. INSTEAD, IT RETAINED SOME - BUT NOT ALL ELECTRONIC INFORMATION IN ITS SYSTEMS FOR EACH SUCH LETTER SO
THAT COPIES COULD BE REGENERATED AT A LATER DATE. IN ADDITION, IN
RESPONSE TO DOCUMENT REQUESTS IN CUSTOMERS' ARBITRATIONS,
JPMS PRODUCED REGENERATED COPIES OF INVESTOR PROFILE UPDATE
LETTERS THAT REFLECTED DIFFERENT REGIONAL SUPERVISORY
MANAGERS FROM THOSE WHO SIGNED THE ORIGINAL LETTERS. WHILE IT
BECAME AWARE OF THIS ISSUE IN CONNECTION WITH AT LEAST ONE OF
THOSE CUSTOMER ARBITRATIONS, IT DID NOT NOTIFY CLAIMANTS AT THE

OF THIS ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S OFFER, THE COMMISSION FINDS
THAT THIS MATTER ARISES FROM FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS
IN CERTAIN FIRM MARKETING MATERIALS REGARDING HOW IT
COMPENSATED REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES IN ITS U.S. PRIVATE
BANK. BETWEEN 2009 AND 2012, THE FIRM MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING
STATEMENTS IN CERTAIN MARKETING MATERIALS DISTRIBUTED TO ITS
PRIVATE BANKING CUSTOMERS CONCERNING THE FACTORS IT USED TO
DETERMINE COMPENSATION FOR ITS PRIVATE BANK'S REGISTERED
REPRESENTATIVES, ALSO KNOWN AT THE FIRM AS "ADVISORS". ON ITS
PRIVATE BANKING WEBSITE AND IN CERTAIN OTHER PRIVATE BANK
MARKETING MATERIALS DISTRIBUTED TO CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE
CUSTOMERS, THE FIRM STATED THAT ADVISOR COMPENSATION WAS
BASED SOLELY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTMENTS IN
CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. SPECIFICALLY, THE FIRM STATED THAT IT
"COMPENSATE[S] OUR ADVISORS BASED ON OUR CLIENTS'
PERFORMANCE; NO ONE IS PAID ON COMMISSION" ("COMPENSATION
MISSTATEMENT"). ALTHOUGH THE FIRM DID NOT PAY ITS PRIVATE BANK
ADVISORS COMMISSIONS, CONTRARY TO ITS REPRESENTATIONS,
ADVISOR COMPENSATION WAS NOT "BASED ON CLIENTS' PERFORMANCE"
BUT WAS INSTEAD COMPRISED OF SALARY AND A DISCRETIONARY
BONUS THAT TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION A NUMBER OF OTHER
FACTORS. BETWEEN MARCH 2009 AND FEBRUARY 2011, THE
COMPENSATION MISSTATEMENT WAS IDENTIFIED BY FIRM EMPLOYEES AS
INACCURATE ON FOUR OCCASIONS BUT THE FIRM FAILED TO CORRECT
THE MISSTATEMENT. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE,
THE FIRM WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 17(A)(2) OF THE SECURITIES

CLIENTS' PERFORMANCE" BUT WAS INSTEAD COMPRISED OF SALARY
AND A DISCRETIONARY BONUS THAT TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION A
NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS. BETWEEN MARCH 2009 AND FEBRUARY
2011, THE COMPENSATION MISSTATEMENT WAS IDENTIFIED BY FIRM
EMPLOYEES AS INACCURATE ON FOUR OCCASIONS BUT THE FIRM FAILED
TO CORRECT THE MISSTATEMENT IN ALL THE PLACES IT APPEARS IN THE
MARKETING MATERIALS. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED
ABOVE, THE FIRM WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 17(A)(2) OF THE

MUTUAL FUNDS. FINALLY, UNTIL NOVEMBER 2013, THE FIRM FAILED TO
DISCLOSE TO CSP CLIENTS THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN LESS
EXPENSIVE PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUND SHARE CLASSES. AS A RESULT,
THE FIRM BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTY TO CSP CLIENTS BY FAILING

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT TO WIN
INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS FROM A COMPANY, JPMS' EQUITY
RESEARCH ANALYST PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRM'S SOLICITATION EFFORTS
OF THE COMPANY'S PLANNED INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO). THE
FINDINGS STATED THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS
INVITED JPMS AND OTHER BROKER-DEALERS TO COMPETE FOR A ROLE
IN THE COMPANY'S IPO. JPMS ALLOWED ITS RESEARCH ANALYST TO
PRESENT HIS VIEWS ON THE COMPANY TO ITS MANAGEMENT AND
PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS. BEFORE THE COMPANY AWARDED ITS IPO
BUSINESS, IT ASKED THE EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS FROM THE FIRMS
COMPETING FOR THE BUSINESS TO MAKE PRESENTATIONS TO ITS
MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS. THE COMPANY PROVIDED
SPECIFIC TOPICS FOR THE ANALYSTS TO ADDRESS AND PUT THE FIRMS
ON NOTICE THAT, AS PART OF THE UNDERWRITER-SELECTION PROCESS,
IT WOULD CONSIDER EACH ANALYST'S VIEWS OF THE COMPANY AND
WHETHER THE ANALYST'S VALUATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM'S
INVESTMENT BANKERS' VALUATION. JPMS' RESEARCH ANALYST
PRESENTED TO THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS,
THEREBY PARTICIPATING IN THE FIRM'S EFFORTS TO SOLICIT
INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS FROM THE COMPANY. THE FINDINGS
ALSO STATED THAT JPMS OFFERED FAVORABLE RESEARCH TO INDUCE
THE COMPANY TO AWARD THE FIRM ITS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.
THE FIRM'S ANALYST'S PRESENTATION TO THE COMPANY AND THE
PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS SUPPORTED THE FIRM'S INVESTMENT BANKING
PITCH AND OFFERED A POSITIVE EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY.
MOREOVER, FOLLOWING THE ANALYST'S PRESENTATION, THE COMPANY
ASKED JPMS TO COMPLETE A TEMPLATE SHOWING AN "EQUITY
COMMITMENT COMMITTEE APPROV[ED]" VALUATION OF IT, WHICH WOULD
INCLUDE THE ANALYST'S VIEWS ON THE COMPANY'S VALUATION. THE
COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS ASKED THE FIRMS TO
COMPLETE THE TEMPLATE AND PROVIDE A FIRM -WIDE VALUATION THAT
THE FIRM, INCLUDING ITS ANALYST, WOULD BE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT
AFTER THE COMPANY AWARDED ITS IPO BUSINESS, ABSENT
UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS. INDEED, THE COMPANY TOLD SOME
FIRMS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE TEMPLATE WAS TO PREVENT IT FROM
BEING "BURNED" BY AN ANALYST'S DECISION TO ADOPT A NEGATIVE VIEW
OF THE COMPANY AFTER IT HAD AWARDED ITS INVESTMENT BANKING
BUSINESS TO THE ANALYST'S FIRM. JPMS COMPLIED WITH THE
COMPANY'S REQUEST. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT JPMS FAILED

FINE OF $5,000,000 AND A CENSURE, BASED ON FINRA'S FINDINGS AS
DESCRIBED BELOW. IN APRIL 2010, TOYS R US (TRU) AND ITS PRIVATE
EQUITY OWNERS INVITED JPMS AND OTHER BROKER-DEALERS TO
COMPETE FOR A ROLE IN TRU'S PLANNED INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (THE
TRU IPO). FINRA FOUND THAT TO WIN THIS INVESTMENT BANKING
BUSINESS FROM TRU JPMS' EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST PARTICIPATED
IN THE FIRM'S SOLICITATION EFFORTS, AND THE FIRM OFFERED
FAVORABLE RESEARCH COVERAGE TO TRU. MOREOVER, FINRA FOUND
THAT JPMS FAILED TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE WRITTEN
SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES GOVERNING ANALYST INVOLVEMENT IN
INVESTMENT BANKING SOLICITATIONS AND OFFERS OF FAVORABLE
RESEARCH COVERAGE. THEREFORE, FINRA FOUND THAT, IN THE
CONTEXT OF THE TRU IPO, JPMS VIOLATED THREE SEPARATE
PROVISIONS OF NASD RULE 2711: 2711(C)(4); 2711(E); AND 2711(I).

SEC ADMIN RELEASE 34-73502 / NOVEMBER 3, 2014: THE SECURITIES AND

PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 15(B), 15B(C)(2) AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934 AGAINST J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC ("J.P. MORGAN" OR
"RESPONDENT"). IN ANTICIPATION OF THE INSTITUTION OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS, RESPONDENT HAS SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF
SETTLEMENT (THE "OFFER") WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED
TO ACCEPT. SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND
ANY OTHER PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE
COMMISSION, OR TO WHICH THE COMMISSION IS A PARTY, AND WITHOUT
ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS HEREIN, EXCEPT AS TO THE
COMMISSION'S JURISDICTION OVER IT AND THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
THESE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE ADMITTED, RESPONDENT CONSENTS
TO THE ENTRY OF THIS ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 15(B),
15B(C)(2) AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASE-ANDDESIST ORDER. ON THE BASIS OF THIS ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S
OFFER, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT: THESE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE
THE SALE OF NON-INVESTMENT GRADE OR "JUNK" BONDS ISSUED BY THE
COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO ("PUERTO RICO") BY J.P. MORGAN, A
REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES DEALER, TO A
CUSTOMER IN AN AMOUNT BELOW THE MINIMUM DENOMINATION OF THE
ISSUE. RULE G-15(F) PROMULGATED BY THE MUNICIPAL SECURITIES
RULEMAKING BOARD ("MSRB") PROHIBITS DEALERS FROM EFFECTING
CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS IN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES IN AMOUNTS
BELOW THE MINIMUM DENOMINATIONS OF THE ISSUES. MINIMUM
DENOMINATIONS ARE GENERALLY INTENDED TO LIMIT SALES OF
MUNICIPAL SECURITIES TO RETAIL INVESTORS FOR WHOM SUCH BONDS
MAY NOT BE SUITABLE, BUT THE PROSCRIPTIONS OF RULE G-15(F) APPLY
TO ALL TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMERS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
THE SECURITIES ARE SUITABLE FOR THE CUSTOMER. IN MARCH 2014, J.P.
MORGAN VIOLATED MSRB RULE G-15(F) BY EXECUTING ONE UNSOLICITED
SALES TRANSACTION IN THE PUERTO RICO BONDS WITH A CUSTOMER IN
AN AMOUNT BELOW THE $100,000 MINIMUM DENOMINATION OF THE ISSUE
ESTABLISHED BY THE ISSUER, PUERTO RICO, AND SPECIFIED IN THE
OFFICIAL STATEMENT. THE LIMITED EXCEPTIONS PROVIDED UNDER MSRB
RULE G-15(F) FOR CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS IN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES
BELOW THE MINIMUM DENOMINATION OF AN ISSUE DID NOT APPLY TO
THIS TRANSACTION. RESPONDENT INFORMED THE CUSTOMER OF THE
RISKS OF TRADING IN THE 2014 BONDS BEFORE EXECUTING THE TRADE.
AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT, RESPONDENT WILLFULLY VIOLATED
MSRB RULE G-15(F). AS A RESULT OF RESPONDENT'S WILLFUL
VIOLATIONS OF MSRB RULE G-15(F), RESPONDENT WILLFULLY VIOLATED
SECTION 15B(C)(1) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT.

CFTC RELEASE PR6968-14, JULY 29, 2014: THE CFTC HAS REASON TO
BELIEVE THAT J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC VIOLATED THE COMMODITY
EXCHANGE ACT AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS. THEREFORE, THE
COMMISSION DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE,
INSTITUTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FIRM HAS ENGAGED IN THE
VIOLATIONS AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY ORDER SHOULD BE
ISSUED IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE
INSTITUTION OF THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, THE FIRM HAS
SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT, WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS
DETERMINED TO ACCEPT. WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING ANY OF THE
FINDINGS OR CONCLUSIONS HEREIN, THE FIRM CONSENTS TO THE
ENTRY OF THIS ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(C) AND 6(D) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGES
SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. SINCE AT LEAST 2012, THE COMMISSION BEGAN
NOTIFYING THE FIRM ABOUT ERRORS IN ITS LARGE TRADER REPORTS,
WHICH INCREASED IN FREQUENCY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN
DECEMBER 2012, THE FIRM WAS NOTIFIED BY THE COMMISSION THAT THE
ON-GOING PROBLEMS WERE UNACCEPTABLE. THE FIRM USED A THIRDPARTY VENDOR FOR THE PREPARATION OF ITS LARGE TRADER REPORTS.
THE FIRM, RELYING ON THAT THIRD-PARTY VENDOR, ASSURED
COMMISSION STAFF THAT THE PROBLEM, WHICH IT UNDERSTOOD AT THE
TIME TO BE RELATED TO AVERAGE PRICE TRANSACTIONS, WOULD BE
RESOLVED ON OR BEFORE THE END OF JANUARY 2013. HOWEVER, THE
FIRM DID NOT RESOLVE ALL OF ITS REPORTING ISSUES AND CONTINUED
TO SUBMIT LARGE TRADER REPORTS THAT CONTAINED HUNDREDS OF
ERRORS THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 1, 2013 TO
FEBRUARY 2014. DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, THE FIRM'S LARGE
TRADER REPORTS FAILED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS TO REPORT THE
ACTUAL NUMBER OF DELIVERY NOTICES ISSUED AND STOPPED AND
INACCURATELY REPORTED THE NUMBER OF EXCHANGES FOR RELATED
POSITIONS BOUGHT AND SOLD. THE FIRM FAILED TO FULLY AND TIMELY
CORRECT THE REPORTING ERRORS DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD.

THE ARKANSAS SECURITIES COMMISSIONER ENTERED INTO A CONSENT
ORDER (ORDER NO. S-14-0034-14-OR01) WITH J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES
LLC ("JPMS") ON JULY 28, 2014. THE CONSENT ORDER WAS BASED ON A
GLOBAL SETTLEMENT BETWEEN JPMS AND A NUMBER OF STATES, LED BY
A MEMBER TASK FORCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES
ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION ("NASAA"), REGARDING JPMS'S FAILURE
TO PROPERLY REGISTER CERTAIN SALES ASSISTANTS AS BROKERDEALER REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS ITS FAILURE TO
DEVELOP A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT
SALES ASSISTANTS FROM ACCEPTING CLIENT ORDERS FROM
JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE SALES ASSISTANTS WERE NOT REGISTERED.
ADDITIONALLY, THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT A TRADE ENTRY SYSTEM
USED BY SOME JPMS BUSINESS UNITS WAS NOT DESIGNED TO RECORD
THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO ACCEPTED CLIENT ORDERS. AS A
RESULT, JPMS VIOLATED THE BOOKS & RECORDS REQUIREMENTS BY
FAILING TO MAINTAIN A RECORD IDENTIFYING THE ACCEPTOR OF MANY
CLIENT ORDERS FROM 2008 TO 2011. JPMS CONSEQUENTLY ENGAGED IN
CONDUCT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY UNDER ARK. CODE ANN. §§ 23-42-301,
306, AND 308, AND RULE 306.01 OF THE RULES OF THE ARKANSAS
SECURITIES COMMISSIONER. JPMS AGREED TO PAY $2,790,625 TO BE
DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE 50 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,
PUERTO RICO, AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. THE CONSENT ORDER
IMPOSED A PENALTY OF $53,925.00 AS ARKANSAS'S PORTION OF THE
TOTAL SETTLEMENT AMOUNT.

APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING SEC AND
FINRA RULES, REGARDING AGGREGATION OF POSITIONS IN A SECURITY
TO DETERMINE THE NET POSITIONS OF THE FIRM'S AGUS. SPECIFICALLY,
THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REGARDING
AGGREGATION OF POSITIONS IN A SECURITY IMPROPERLY PERMITTED
THE INCLUSION OF THE NON-BROKER-DEALER AFFILIATE'S TRADING
POSITIONS IN DETERMINING THE NET POSITIONS OF THE FIRM'S AGUS.
THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE AGU REQUIREMENTS
DESCRIBED ABOVE AFFECTED THE ACCURACY OF THE FIRM'S
CALCULATION OF ITS NET POSITIONS IN SECURITIES, AND THE FIRM'S
ABILITY TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF ITS SHORT SALES, TRADE
REPORTS AND BOOKS AND RECORDS, WHICH IN TURN MAY HAVE
RESULTED IN VIOLATIONS OF VARIOUS SEC AND FINRA RULES
REGARDING SHORT SALES, TRADE REPORTING, AND BOOKS AND
RECORDS.

MEMBERS ON THE PER-BOND BASIS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE
WAS ANY DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT BOND ISSUANCE AND
THE ASSOCIATION'S ACTIVITIES, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE
ASSOCIATION PROVIDED ANY SERVICES REQUIRED FOR THE
UNDERWRITING. THE FIRM PAID THE ASSOCIATION A TOTAL OF $215,716
FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE UNDERWRITING OF APPROXIMATELY 90
APPLICABLE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM OBTAINED REIMBURSEMENT FOR
THE VOLUNTARY PAYMENTS FROM THE PROCEEDS OF MUNICIPAL AND
STATE BOND OFFERINGS WHICH WAS UNFAIR. THE ASSESSMENTS DID
NOT HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO ANY ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED WITH
RESPECT TO EACH BOND OFFERING. THE FIRM WAS NOT REQUIRED BY
ANY STATUTE OR REGULATION TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION
YET TREATED ITS ASSESSMENTS AS AN EXPENSE OF EACH TRANSACTION
AND REQUESTED AND RECEIVED REIMBURSEMENT OF THE PAYMENTS
FROM THE PROCEEDS OF EACH BOND OFFERING. THE FIRM LISTED THE
UNDERWRITING ASSESSMENTS AS EXPENSES OF THE UNDERWRITING
BUT ITS REQUESTS FOR REIMBURSEMENT WERE NOT FAIR BECAUSE
THEY WERE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE TO ISSUERS.
THE FIRM'S PRACTICES RESULTED IN THE EXPENDITURE OF THE
PROCEEDS OF MUNICIPAL AND STATE BOND OFFERINGS TO AN
ORGANIZATION ENGAGED IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. IN RESPONSE TO A
REQUEST FROM THE TREASURER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THE
FIRM HAS RETURNED $49,040 TO MULTIPLE ISSUERS AS A REFUND FOR
THE UNDERWRITING ASSESSMENTS REIMBURSED FROM OFFERING
PROCEEDS. THE FIRM FAILED TO ADOPT, MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE
WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS) REASONABLY DESIGNED
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH MSRB RULE G-17. THE FIRM FAILED TO
ESTABLISH REASONABLE PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING AND
DISCLOSING EXPENSES FOR MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ASSOCIATIONS FOR

IN ANTICIPATION OF THE INSTITUTION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDING, JPMS SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT, WHICH THE
CFTC DETERMINED TO ACCEPT. WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING ANY
OF THE FINDINGS OR CONCLUSIONS HEREIN, JPMS CONSENTED TO THE
ENTRY OF THE ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(C) AND 6(D) OF THE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL SANCTIONS ("ORDER"). THE CFTC ORDER FOUND THAT ON
ONE OCCASION IN 2010, A JPMS MORGAN EMPLOYEE ENGAGED IN PREEXECUTION COMMUNICATIONS WITH A CUSTOMER. THE CUSTOMER
DIRECTED THE JPMS EMPLOYEE TO SELL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TEN
YEAR TREASURY SPREADS, AND ALSO TOLD THE JPMS EMPLOYEE TO
LOOK FOR ANY "ALL OR NONES," AS THE CUSTOMER WANTED TO BUY
THOSE SPREADS. AN "ALL OR NONE" ORDER MUST BE FILLED IN ITS
ENTIRETY. THE JPMS EMPLOYEE IDENTIFIED AN ALL OR NONE BID FOR
THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT AS THE SELL ORDER AND SOLD TO THAT BID,
WITH THE RESULT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
TRANSACTION, ACCORDING TO THE ORDER. THE ORDER FOUND THAT
JPMS, THROUGH ITS EMPLOYEE, CONFIRMED THE EXECUTION OF A
PREARRANGED TRADE, WHICH WAS BOTH NONCOMPETITIVELY
EXECUTED AND A FICTITIOUS SALE. THE ORDER FOUND JPMS LIABLE
FOR ITS EMPLOYEE'S VIOLATIONS OF THE CEA AND CFTC REGULATIONS,
AS THE EMPLOYEE WAS ACTING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF HIS EMPLOYMENT
WITH JPMS. THE CFTC ORDERED JPMS TO: CEASE AND DESIST FROM
VIOLATING SECTION 4C(A)(1) OF THE ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE DODDFRANK ACT, TO BE CODIFIED AT 7 U.S.C. § 6C(A)(1), AND COMMISSION
REGULATION 1.38(A), 17 C.F.R. § 1.38(A)(2011); PAY A $140,000 FINE WITHIN

2711(H)(9), 3010: THE FIRM PUBLISHED A RESEARCH REPORT
DOWNGRADING A COMPANY FROM NEUTRAL TO UNDERWEIGHT. ONE OF
THE PRINCIPAL, STATED REASONS FOR THE DOWNGRADE WAS THAT THE
COMPANY HAD RELEASED INTO INCOME $1.1 BILLION IN RESERVES
BASED ON THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD WIN CERTAIN LAWSUITS IN
WHICH THE COMPANY WAS THE PLAINTIFF. THE FIRM'S ANALYST
CRITICIZED THAT DECISION, POINTING OUT THAT ANY POTENTIAL
RECOVERY WAS UNCERTAIN AND AT LEAST THREE YEARS IN THE
FUTURE. THE DOWNGRADE REPORT DISCUSSED LAWSUITS AGAINST THE
COMPANY WITHOUT DISCLOSING THAT THE FIRM'S BANKING AFFILIATE
WAS A PLAINTIFF IN ONE OF THE LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COMPANY.
AFTER PUBLICATION OF THE REPORT, THE COMPANY COMPLAINED TO
THE FIRM ABOUT THE RESEARCH REPORT, INCLUDING THE FIRM'S
FAILURE TO DISCLOSE ITS AFFILIATE'S ROLE IN ONE OF THE PENDING
LAWSUITS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS COMPLAINT, THE FIRM AGREED IN THE
SPIRIT OF COOPERATION, AND TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY'S CONCERNS,
TO VOLUNTARILY RE-POST A REVISED REPORT CONTAINING AN
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE. THE FIRM ISSUED A REVISED REPORT THAT
ADDED IN RELEVANT PART, BUT IT DID NOT REMOVE THE ORIGINAL
REPORT, WHICH CONTINUED TO BE AVAILABLE ON ITS WEBSITE FOR
OVER A YEAR, AND DID NOT REDISTRIBUTE THE REVISED REPORT TO THE
APPROXIMATELY 900 PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED THE ORIGINAL REPORT.
THEREFORE, THE ORIGINAL RESEARCH REPORT WAS NOT FAIR AND
BALANCED AND DID NOT PROVIDE A SOUND BASIS FOR READERS TO
PROPERLY EVALUATE ALL RELEVANT FACTS. THE FIRM PERMITTED A
MANAGER TO SUPERVISE SEVERAL EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS
WITHOUT BEING PROPERLY LICENSED AS A RESEARCH PRINCIPAL (RP);
DURING THAT TIME, THE MANAGER HAD NOT PASSED THE SERIES 87 AND
NEVER SOUGHT TO BE REGISTERED AS A SERIES 16. THE MANAGER
CEASED SUPERVISING THESE RESEARCH ANALYSTS, WHEN THE FIRM

CEASED SUPERVISING THESE RESEARCH ANALYSTS, WHEN THE FIRM

RESEARCH ANALYSTS FOR NINE MONTHS WITHOUT BEING PROPERLY
QUALIFIED. THE FIRM KNEW THAT THE MANAGER NEEDED TO OBTAIN A
SERIES 87 AROUND THE TIME THE MANAGER WAS PROMOTED, BUT
FAILED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION RULES.
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MANAGER'S SERIES 87 TEST WINDOW WAS
NOT OPENED UNTIL EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THE PROMOTION, AND THE
MANAGER WAS PERMITTED TO SUPERVISE ANALYSTS FOR AN
ADDITIONAL MONTH. THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY POLICIES WERE
NOT TIMELY AMENDED TO REFLECT THE RP REQUIREMENT. THE FIRM'S

MAKER ENTERED CONTEMPORANEOUS BUY AND SELL ORDERS IN
DIFFERENT SECURITIES IN THE FIRM'S ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM
SO THAT THE RESULTING TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED AGAINST ONE
ANOTHER IN NUMEROUS SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS, CREATING A FALSE
APPEARANCE OF MARKET ACTIVITY IN THE SECURITIES. EACH OF THE
SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS WAS PUBLICLY REPORTED TO NASDAQ

SALES MATERIALS CONCERNING SECURITIES OFFERINGS DURING THE

E-MAILS AT THE TIME THEY WERE TRANSMITTED, INCLUDING DOZENS OF
E-MAILS THAT DESCRIBED OFFERINGS AS ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITIES, WITHOUT IDENTIFYING ANY RISK FACTORS, AND EMAILS THAT ATTACHED "INTERNAL USE ONLY" SALES MEMORANDA..
BECAUSE BEAR STEARNS SALESPERSONS VIOLATED SECTION 5(B) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT, AND THE FIRM FAILED TO EMPLOY AN EFFECTIVE
SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT THE PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO DETECT OR
PREVENT SUCH VIOLATIONS, BEAR STEARNS FAILED REASONABLY TO

SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 22533, NOVEMBER 16, 2012: IN COORDINATION
WITH THE FEDERAL-STATE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED
SECURITIES WORKING GROUP, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION CHARGED J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND AFFILIATED
ENTITIES WITH MISLEADING INVESTORS IN OFFERINGS OF RESIDENTIAL
MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS). THE FIRM AGREED TO A
SETTLEMENT IN WHICH IT WILL PAY $296.9 MILLION. THE SEC PLANS TO
DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY TO HARMED INVESTORS.
THE SEC ALLEGED THAT JP MORGAN MISSTATED INFORMATION ABOUT
THE DELINQUENCY STATUS OF MORTGAGE LOANS THAT PROVIDED
COLLATERAL FOR AN RMBS OFFERING IN WHICH IT WAS THE
UNDERWRITER. JP MORGAN RECEIVED FEES OF MORE THAN $2.7
MILLION, AND INVESTORS SUSTAINED LOSSES OF AT LEAST $37 MILLION
ON UNDISCLOSED DELINQUENT LOANS. JP MORGAN ALSO IS CHARGED
FOR AN ACQUIRED FIRM'S FAILURE TO DISCLOSE ITS PRACTICE OF
OBTAINING AND KEEPING CASH SETTLEMENTS FROM MORTGAGE LOAN
ORIGINATORS ON PROBLEM LOANS THAT THE FIRM HAD SOLD INTO RMBS
TRUSTS. THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS BULK SETTLEMENT PRACTICE WERE
AT LEAST $137.8 MILLION.
ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT AGAINST JP MORGAN FILED IN
FEDERAL COURT IN WASHINGTON D.C., FEDERAL REGULATIONS UNDER
THE SECURITIES LAWS REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF DELINQUENCY
INFORMATION RELATED TO ASSETS THAT PROVIDE COLLATERAL FOR AN
ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES OFFERING. INFORMATION ABOUT THE
DELINQUENCY STATUS OF MORTGAGE LOANS IN AN RMBS TRANSACTION
IS IMPORTANT TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THOSE LOANS ARE THE PRIMARY
SOURCE OF FUNDS BY WHICH INVESTORS CAN EARN INTEREST AND
OBTAIN REPAYMENT OF THEIR PRINCIPAL.

THE SEC ALLEGED THAT IN THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT FOR THE $1.8
BILLION RMBS OFFERING THAT OCCURRED IN DECEMBER 2006, JP
MORGAN MADE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT
THE LOANS THAT PROVIDED COLLATERAL FOR THE TRANSACTION. THE
FIRM REPRESENTED THAT ONLY FOUR LOANS (.04 PERCENT OF THE
TOTAL LOANS COLLATERALIZING THE TRANSACTION) WERE DELINQUENT

THE SEC ALLEGED THAT IN THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT FOR THE $1.8
BILLION RMBS OFFERING THAT OCCURRED IN DECEMBER 2006, JP
MORGAN MADE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT
THE LOANS THAT PROVIDED COLLATERAL FOR THE TRANSACTION. THE
FIRM REPRESENTED THAT ONLY FOUR LOANS (.04 PERCENT OF THE
TOTAL LOANS COLLATERALIZING THE TRANSACTION) WERE DELINQUENT
BY 30 TO 59 DAYS, AND THAT THOSE FOUR WERE THE ONLY LOANS THAT
HAD HAD AN INSTANCE OF DELINQUENCY OF 30 OR MORE DAYS IN THE 12
MONTHS PRIOR TO THE "CUT-OFF DATE" FOR THE TRANSACTION.
HOWEVER, AT THE TIME JP MORGAN MADE THESE REPRESENTATIONS, JP
MORGAN ACTUALLY HAD INFORMATION SHOWING THAT MORE THAN 620
LOANS (ABOVE 7 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LOANS COLLATERALIZING THE
TRANSACTION) WERE, AND HAD BEEN, 30 TO 59 DAYS DELINQUENT, AND
THE FOUR LOANS REPRESENTED AS BEING 30 TO 59 DAYS DELINQUENT
WERE IN FACT 60 TO 89 DAYS DELINQUENT.

User Guidance

THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALSO ALLEGED THAT THE ACQUIRED FIRM'S BULK
SETTLEMENTS COVERED LOANS COLLATERALIZING 156 DIFFERENT RMBS
TRANSACTIONS ISSUED FROM 2005 TO 2007. LOAN ORIGINATORS WERE
USUALLY REQUIRED BY CONTRACT TO BUY BACK LOANS THAT SUFFERED
EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULTS OR HAD OTHER DEFECTS. HOWEVER, THE
FIRM FREQUENTLY NEGOTIATED DISCOUNTED CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH
THESE LOAN ORIGINATORS IN LIEU OF A BUY-BACK ON LOANS THAT WERE
OWNED BY THE RMBS TRUSTS. THE FIRM - BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE
MERGER WITH JP MORGAN - THEN KEPT MOST OF THE BULK
SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS. THE FIRM FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE PRACTICE
TO INVESTORS WHO OWNED THE LOANS. THE FIRM REPURCHASED ONLY
ABOUT 13 PERCENT OF THESE DEFECTIVE BULK SETTLEMENT LOANS
FROM THE TRUSTS, COMPARED TO A NEARLY 100 PERCENT REPURCHASE
RATE WHEN LOAN ORIGINATORS AGREED TO BUY BACK THE DEFECTIVE
LOANS. FOR MOST LOANS COVERED BY BULK SETTLEMENTS, THE FIRM
COLLECTED MONEY FROM ORIGINATORS WITHOUT PAYING ANYTHING TO
THE TRUSTS.
JP MORGAN AND ONE OF ITS AFFILIATES SETTLED THE SEC'S CHARGES
BY CONSENTING TO PAY DISGORGEMENT OF $39,900,000, PREJUDGMENT
INTEREST OF $10,600,000, AND A PENALTY OF $24,000,000 FOR THE
DELINQUENCY MISSTATEMENTS, WHICH THE SEC WILL SEEK TO
DISTRIBUTE TO HARMED INVESTORS IN THE TRANSACTION THROUGH A
FAIR FUND. (CONTINUED IN COMMENT)

SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 22031, JULY 7, 2011: THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("COMMISSION") CHARGED J.P. MORGAN
SECURITIES LLC ("JPMS") WITH FRAUDULENTLY RIGGING AT LEAST 93
MUNICIPAL BOND REINVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS IN 31 STATES,
GENERATING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ILL-GOTTEN GAINS. THE
COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT JPMS VIOLATED SECTION 15(C)(1)(A) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 ("EXCHANGE ACT").
TYPICALLY, WHEN INVESTORS PURCHASE MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, THE
MUNICIPALITIES TEMPORARILY INVEST THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALES IN
MUNICIPAL REINVESTMENT PRODUCTS UNTIL THE MONEY IS USED FOR
THE INTENDED PURPOSES. UNDER RELEVANT INTERNAL REVENUE
SERVICE ("IRS") REGULATIONS, THE PROCEEDS OF TAX-EXEMPT
MUNICIPAL SECURITIES GENERALLY MUST BE INVESTED AT FAIR MARKET
VALUE. THE MOST COMMON WAY OF ESTABLISHING FAIR MARKET VALUE
IS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS IN WHICH BIDDING
AGENTS SEARCH FOR THE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT VEHICLE FOR A
MUNICIPALITY.
THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT FROM 1997 THROUGH 2005, JPMS'S
FRAUDULENT PRACTICES, MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS
UNDERMINED THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS, AFFECTED THE
PRICES THAT MUNICIPALITIES PAID FOR REINVESTMENT PRODUCTS, AND
DEPRIVED CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES OF A CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION
THAT THE REINVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS HAD BEEN PURCHASED AT FAIR
MARKET VALUE. JPMS'S FRAUDULENT CONDUCT ALSO JEOPARDIZED THE
TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES
BECAUSE THE SUPPOSED COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS THAT
ESTABLISHES THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT WAS
CORRUPTED. THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT
ARE NO LONGER WITH THE COMPANY.

THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT JPMS, ACTING AS THE AGENT FOR ITS
AFFILIATED COMMERCIAL BANK, AT TIMES WON BIDS BECAUSE IT
OBTAINED INFORMATION FROM THE BIDDING AGENTS ABOUT COMPETING
BIDS, A PRACTICE KNOWN AS "LAST LOOKS." IN OTHER INSTANCES, IT
WON BIDS SET UP IN ADVANCE FOR JPMS TO WIN (SET-UPS) BECAUSE

THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES CREATED THE
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO FOR SQUARED CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF
CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS ("CDS") REFERENCING OTHER CDO SECURITIES
WHOSE VALUE WAS TIED TO THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL HOUSING MARKET.
THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT THE MARKETING MATERIALS FOR

SELECTED BY A REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH EXPERIENCE
ANALYZING CREDIT RISK IN CDOS. UNDISCLOSED IN THE MARKETING
MATERIALS AND UNKNOWN TO INVESTORS, A HEDGE FUND, WHICH WAS
POISED TO BENEFIT IF THE CDOS DEFAULTED, PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT
ROLE IN SELECTING WHICH CDOS SHOULD MAKE UP THE PORTFOLIO.
WHILE PARTICIPATING IN THE SELECTION OF THE INVESTMENT
PORTFOLIO, THE HEDGE FUND SHORTED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF
THE ASSETS IT HELPED TO SELECT BY ENTERING INTO CDS TO BUY
PROTECTION ON THEM. THE CDO SECURITIES THE HEDGE FUND
SHORTED HAD A NOTIONAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION,
REPRESENTING OVER HALF OF SQUARED'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

SETTLED CHARGES AGAINST BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC. ("DEFENDANT"),
BROKERAGE FIRM AND INVESTMENT BANK, ARISING FROM AN
INVESTIGATION OF RESEARCH ANALYST CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE
SEC TODAY FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST DEFENDANT IN THE U.S.
DISTRICT COURT ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF NASD AND NYSE RULES.
FROM AT LEAST JULY 1999 THROUGH JUNE 2001, RESEARCH ANALYSTS AT
BEAR STEARNS WERE SUBJECT TO INAPPROPRIATE INFLUENCE BY
INVESTMENT BANKING AT THE FIRM. BEAR STEARNS PUBLISHED
EXAGGERATED OR UNWARRANTED RESEARCH OR RESEARCH THAT
LACKED A REASONABLE BASIS, MADE A PAYMENT TO ANOTHER FIRM FOR
THAT FIRM TO PUBLISH RESEARCH ON A BEAR STEARNS' UNDERWRITING
CLIENT WITHOUT ENSURING THAT SUCH PAYMENT WAS DISCLOSED, AND
FAILED TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION OVER ITS RESEARCH
AND INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, THE SEC'S
COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT: BEAR STEARNS' ANALYSTS WERE EXPECTED
TO WORK WITH INVESTMENT BANKERS TO PROCURE INVESTMENT
BANKING BUSINESS, AND PARTICIPATED IN "PITCHES" IN WHICH ANALYSTS
MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO POTENTIAL BANKING CLIENTS
CONCERNING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FREQUENCY OF COVERAGE THAT
POTENTIAL INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS COULD EXPECT. BEAR
STEARNS MADE A PAYMENT TO ANOTHER BROKER-DEALER IN
CONNECTION WITH RESEARCH COVERAGE PROVIDED BY THE OTHER
BROKER-DEALER ON A COMPANY, A BEAR STEARNS UNDERWRITING
CLIENT, WITHOUT ENSURING THAT THE PAYMENT WAS DISCLOSED. THE
POLICIES, SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES THAT BEAR STEARNS HAD IN
PLACE WITH RESPECT TO ITS ANALYSTS WERE INADEQUATE AND DID NOT
ADDRESS THE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE EXPECTATIONS
THAT ANALYSTS SUPPORT BEAR STEARNS' INVESTMENT BANKING
BUSINESS AND ANALYSTS' PUBLICATION OF OBJECTIVE RESEARCH. THE
SEC ALLEGES THAT BEAR STEARNS VIOLATED NASD CONDUCT RULE
2110, 2210(D)(1), 2210(D)(2)(A) AND 3010, AND NYSE RULES 342, 401, 472
