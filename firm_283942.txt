What is included in a BrokerCheck report?
BrokerCheck reports for individual brokers include information such as employment history, professional
qualifications, disciplinary actions, criminal convictions, civil judgments and arbitration awards. BrokerCheck
reports for brokerage firms include information on a firm’s profile, history, and operations, as well as many of the
same disclosure events mentioned above.
Please note that the information contained in a BrokerCheck report may include pending actions or
allegations that may be contested, unresolved or unproven. In the end, these actions or allegations may be
resolved in favor of the broker or brokerage firm, or concluded through a negotiated settlement with no
admission or finding of wrongdoing.
Where did this information come from?
The information contained in BrokerCheck comes from FINRA’s Central Registration Depository, or
CRD® and is a combination of:
o information FINRA and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) require brokers and
brokerage firms to submit as part of the registration and licensing process, and
o information that regulators report regarding disciplinary actions or allegations against firms or brokers.
How current is this information?
Generally, active brokerage firms and brokers are required to update their professional and disciplinary
information in CRD within 30 days. Under most circumstances, information reported by brokerage firms, brokers
and regulators is available in BrokerCheck the next business day.
What if I want to check the background of an investment adviser firm or investment adviser
representative?
To check the background of an investment adviser firm or representative, you can search for the firm or
individual in BrokerCheck. If your search is successful, click on the link provided to view the available licensing
and registration information in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website at
https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. In the alternative, you may search the IAPD website directly or contact your
state securities regulator at http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/P455414.
Are there other resources I can use to check the background of investment professionals?
FINRA recommends that you learn as much as possible about an investment professional before
deciding to work with them. Your state securities regulator can help you research brokers and investment adviser
representatives doing business in your state.
