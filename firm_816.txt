What is included in a BrokerCheck report?
BrokerCheck reports for individual brokers include information such as employment history, professional
qualifications, disciplinary actions, criminal convictions, civil judgments and arbitration awards. BrokerCheck
reports for brokerage firms include information on a firm’s profile, history, and operations, as well as many of the
same disclosure events mentioned above.
Please note that the information contained in a BrokerCheck report may include pending actions or
allegations that may be contested, unresolved or unproven. In the end, these actions or allegations may be
resolved in favor of the broker or brokerage firm, or concluded through a negotiated settlement with no
admission or finding of wrongdoing.
Where did this information come from?
The information contained in BrokerCheck comes from FINRA’s Central Registration Depository, or
CRD® and is a combination of:
o information FINRA and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) require brokers and
brokerage firms to submit as part of the registration and licensing process, and
o information that regulators report regarding disciplinary actions or allegations against firms or brokers.
How current is this information?
Generally, active brokerage firms and brokers are required to update their professional and disciplinary
information in CRD within 30 days. Under most circumstances, information reported by brokerage firms, brokers
and regulators is available in BrokerCheck the next business day.
What if I want to check the background of an investment adviser firm or investment adviser
representative?
To check the background of an investment adviser firm or representative, you can search for the firm or
individual in BrokerCheck. If your search is successful, click on the link provided to view the available licensing
and registration information in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website at
https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. In the alternative, you may search the IAPD website directly or contact your
state securities regulator at http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/P455414.
Are there other resources I can use to check the background of investment professionals?
FINRA recommends that you learn as much as possible about an investment professional before
deciding to work with them. Your state securities regulator can help you research brokers and investment adviser
representatives doing business in your state.

Disclosure Event Details
What you should know about reported disclosure events:
1. BrokerCheck provides details for any disclosure event that was reported in CRD. It also includes
summary information regarding FINRA arbitration awards in cases where the brokerage firm was
named as a respondent.
2. Certain thresholds must be met before an event is reported to CRD, for example:
o A law enforcement agency must file formal charges before a brokerage firm is required to disclose a
particular criminal event.
3. Disclosure events in BrokerCheck reports come from different sources:
o Disclosure events for this brokerage firm were reported by the firm and/or regulators. When the firm
and a regulator report information for the same event, both versions of the event will appear in the
BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source
labeled.
4. There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:
o A disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, or final.
§ A "pending" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated.
§ An event that is "on appeal" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently
being appealed.
§ A "final" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.
o A final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled or otherwise resolved.
§ An "adjudicated" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter,
or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party
charged with some alleged wrongdoing.
§ A "settled" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter.
Please note that firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for
business or other reasons.
§ A "resolved" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of
wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker. Such matters generally involve customer
disputes.
5. You may wish to contact the brokerage firm to obtain further information regarding any of the
disclosure events contained in this BrokerCheck report.

Regulatory - Final
This type of disclosure event involves (1) a final, formal proceeding initiated by a regulatory authority (e.g., a state
securities agency, self-regulatory organization, federal regulator such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
foreign financial regulatory body) for a violation of investment-related rules or regulations; or (2) a revocation or
suspension of the authority of a brokerage firm or its control affiliate to act as an attorney, accountant or federal
contractor.

SEC ADMIN RELEASE 33-10565; 34-84314, SEPTEMBER 28, 2018.
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("COMMISSION") DEEMS IT
APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED
AGAINST CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC ("RESPONDENT" OR
"CREDIT SUISSE").
THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT BROKER-DEALERS THAT EXECUTE
ORDERS FOR RETAIL CUSTOMERS OFTEN SEND SUCH ORDERS TO
OTHER BROKER-DEALERS THAT SPECIALIZE IN HANDLING SUCH ORDER
FLOW. BETWEEN MID-2011 AND MARCH 2015 (THE "RELEVANT PERIOD"),
CREDIT SUISSE OPERATED A WHOLESALE MARKET MAKING DESK CALLED
RETAIL EXECUTION SERVICES ("RES") IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THIS TYPE
OF ORDER FLOW. DURING THIS PERIOD, RES EXECUTED BOTH "HELD"
AND "NOT HELD" EQUITY ORDERS FOR ITS RETAIL BROKER-DEALER
CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING OVER 15 MILLION HELD RETAIL-ORIGINATED
EQUITY ORDERS (OVER 8.5 BILLION SHARES) HAVING A TOTAL MARKET
VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $227 BILLION. BEGINNING IN MID-2011 AND
CONTINUING UNTIL MARCH 2015, WHEN RES CLOSED, RES MADE
MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS CONCERNING ITS
HANDLING OF HELD RETAIL EQUITY ORDERS, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION
17(A)(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT.
RES SOUGHT TO DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF BY MARKETING ITS ACCESS TO
"VAST" DARK LIQUIDITY IN CREDIT SUISSE'S OWN ALTERNATIVE TRADING
SYSTEM ("ATS") AND DARK POOL, AS WELL AS RES'S ACCESS TO DARK
POOLS OPERATED BY OTHER BROKER-DEALERS. DARK POOLS ARE
MARKETS IN WHICH BIDS AND OFFERS ARE NOT VISIBLE TO MARKET
PARTICIPANTS, UNLIKE DISPLAYED EXCHANGES AND MARKETS (I.E. "LIT
MARKETS"). DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, RES REPRESENTED IN ITS
MARKETING MATERIALS THAT RES OFFERED "ENHANCED LIQUIDITY" BY
ACCESSING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL POOLS OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING
ACCESS TO CREDIT SUISSE'S OWN AND OTHER DARK POOLS. HOWEVER,
RES EXECUTED ONLY A DE MINIMIS NUMBER OF HELD ORDERS (UNLIKE
NOT HELD ORDERS) IN DARK POOLS.
RES FURTHER REPRESENTED IN ITS ORDER HANDLING GUIDE THAT
OPPORTUNITIES FOR "ROBUST" AND "ENHANCED" PRICE IMPROVEMENT
WAS ONE OF THE "CORE" ELEMENTS OF RES'S APPROACH TO EXECUTING
ORDERS. PROVIDING A BETTER PRICE THAN THE CURRENTLY QUOTED
BEST BID OR ASK PRICE IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS "PRICE
IMPROVEMENT." ALTHOUGH RES DESCRIBED THE FACTORS RELEVANT TO
THE SECURITIES FOR WHICH IT WOULD PROVIDE PRICE IMPROVEMENT, IT
DID NOT DISCLOSE THAT A SUBSET OF ORDERS FOR WHICH EXECUTION
QUALITY WAS NOT INCLUDED IN PUBLICLY REPORTED EXECUTION
QUALITY REPORTS PURSUANT TO COMMISSION RULE 605 ("NON-605"
ORDERS) TYPICALLY WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY PRICE IMPROVEMENT.

RES STATED IN ITS ORDER HANDLING GUIDE THAT IT WOULD SEEK TO
EXECUTE CUSTOMER ORDERS AT THE "MOST FAVORABLE TERMS
REASONABLY AVAILABLE." RES ALSO REPRESENTED IN ITS ORDER
HANDLING GUIDE THAT WHEN RES COMMITS CAPITAL, "[T]HE BENEFIT TO
OUR CUSTOMER IS A FILL WITHOUT MARKET IMPACT. THE MORE LIQUIDITY
WE OFFER, THE LESS IMPACT A CUSTOMER'S ORDER WILL HAVE ON THE
NBBO [I.E., THE NATIONAL BEST BID AND OFFER], POTENTIALLY AVOIDING
PRICE DIS-IMPROVEMENT."
DESPITE THESE STATEMENTS, FOR CERTAIN ORDERS, RES USED A
ROUTING TACTIC THAT SENT AN ORDER ONLY TO LIT MARKETS
(REFERRED TO HEREIN AS "ROUTING TACTIC A") WITHOUT FIRST
ATTEMPTING TO FILL THE ORDER IN CREDIT SUISSE'S AND OTHER DARK
POOLS AND ELECTRONIC LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS ("ELPS"). RES APPLIED
ROUTING TACTIC A DISPROPORTIONALLY OFTEN TO NON-605 ORDERS
(IDENTIFIED USING THE "COUNTSFORSTATS" FUNCTION) THAT WERE
LARGER THAN (I.E., "OUTSIZED") THE NUMBER OF SHARES DISPLAYED AT
THE THEN-PREVAILING MARKET PRICE, AND THUS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO
CAUSE MARKET IMPACT. RES'S USE OF ROUTING TACTIC A PROVIDED RES
AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROFIT FROM, OR "CAPTURE," MARKET IMPACT IF
THERE WAS POST-TRADE PRICE REVERSION, IN WHICH STOCK PRICES
THAT HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY DISPLACED AS A RESULT OF MARKET
ACTIVITY MAY REVERT TOWARD THE ORIGINAL PRICE LEVEL. THE
FREQUENCY WITH WHICH RES USED ROUTING TACTIC A FOR CERTAIN
OUTSIZED ORDERS WAS NOT DISCLOSED IN RES'S MARKETING
MATERIALS.

THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 AGAINST CREDIT SUISSE
SECURITIES (USA) LLC. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE INSTITUTION OF THESE
PROCEEDINGS, RESPONDENT HAS SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF
SETTLEMENT WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED TO ACCEPT.
SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND ANY OTHER
PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION, OR TO
WHICH THE COMMISSION IS A PARTY, AND WITHOUT ADMITTING OR
DENYING THE FINDINGS HEREIN, EXCEPT AS TO THE COMMISSION'S
JURISDICTION OVER IT AND THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE
PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE ADMITTED, THE FIRM CONSENTS TO THE
ENTRY OF THIS ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL
SANCTIONS AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER. ON THE BASIS OF THIS
ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S OFFER, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT
THESE PROCEEDINGS ARISE OUT OF BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTY,
INADEQUATE DISCLOSURES, AND DEFICIENCIES IN COMPLIANCE
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM'S IA
REPRESENTATIVES, ALSO REFERRED TO AS RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS
("RMS"), PURCHASED OR HELD CLASS A MUTUAL FUND SHARES FOR
ADVISORY CLIENTS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE OR HOLD LESS
EXPENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL SHARE CLASSES ("ISCS") OF THE SAME
MUTUAL FUNDS. A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASS A SHARES
AND ISCS IS THE EXISTENCE OF MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION FEES
IMPOSED ON CLASS A SHAREHOLDERS PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(B) OF
THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND RULE 12B-1 THEREUNDER ("12B-1
FEES"). THE 12B-1 FEES ARE PAID OUT OF THE ASSETS OF THE FUND AS A
PORTION OF ITS EXPENSE RATIO. IN THIS CASE, THE 12B-1 FEES WERE
PASSED THROUGH TO THE FIRM, WHICH IN TURN PAID A PORTION OF
THAT AMOUNT TO ITS RMS. THUS, 12B-1 FEES DECREASED THE VALUE OF
ADVISORY CLIENTS' INVESTMENTS IN MUTUAL FUNDS AND INCREASED
THE COMPENSATION PAID TO THE FIRM AND ITS RMS. THE FIRM'S
DISCLOSURES DID NOT ADEQUATELY INFORM ITS ADVISORY CLIENTS OF
THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST PRESENTED BY ITS RMS' SHARE CLASS
SELECTION PRACTICES. THE FIRM DISCLOSED IN ITS FORMS ADV AND
CLIENT AGREEMENTS THAT IT "MAY" RECEIVE 12B-1 FEES AS THE RESULT
OF INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN MUTUAL FUNDS AND THAT SUCH FEES
CREATED A CONFLICT OF INTEREST DUE TO A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR
RMS TO SELECT OR RECOMMEND INVESTMENTS THAT MAXIMIZED THIS
COMPENSATION. THE FIRM DID NOT DISCLOSE, HOWEVER, THAT MANY

MUTUAL FUNDS OFFERED A VARIETY OF SHARE CLASSES, INCLUDING
SOME THAT DID NOT PAY 12B-1 FEES AND WERE ACCORDINGLY LESS
EXPENSIVE FOR ELIGIBLE INVESTORS. THUS, THE FIRM'S GENERAL
DISCLOSURES REGARDING ITS POTENTIAL RECEIPT OF 12B-1 FEES WERE
INADEQUATE TO ADVISE ADVISORY CLIENTS THAT AN RM COULD SELECT
OR RECOMMEND - AND IN MANY INSTANCES DID SELECT OR RECOMMEND
- MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS IN SHARE CLASSES THAT PAID 12B-1 FEES
TO THE FIRM WHEN THOSE CLIENTS WERE ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE
SHARE CLASSES OF THE SAME MUTUAL FUNDS THAT DID NOT PAY SUCH
FEES AND WERE LESS EXPENSIVE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM DID NOT
DISCLOSE THAT THOSE RMS RECEIVED 12B-1 FEES FROM THE SALE OF
MUTUAL FUNDS, WHICH CREATED AN INCENTIVE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUAL
RMS TO RECOMMEND CLASS A SHARES. OVER TIME, AS ISCS BECAME
MORE AVAILABLE TO NON-INSTITUTIONAL PURCHASERS, THE FIRM DID
NOT UPDATE ITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO REQUIRE PERSONNEL
SPECIFICALLY TO IDENTIFY OR EVALUATE AVAILABLE INSTITUTIONAL
SHARE CLASSES. MOREOVER, THE FIRM DID NOT UPDATE OR ENHANCE
ITS POLICIES OR PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS INSTANCES IN WHICH RMS
WERE PURCHASING AND HOLDING CLASS A SHARES WHEN LESS COSTLY
ISCS WERE AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONDUCT, THE FIRM
WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 206(2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT, SECTION 207
OF THE ADVISERS ACT, AND SECTION 206(4) OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND
RULE 206(4)-7 THEREUNDER.

THE FINDINGS STATED THAT CSSU FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT

AML POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE REASONABLY DESIGNED
TO DETECT AND CAUSE THE REPORTING/FILING OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
REPORTS (SARS). THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM IN
PLACE TO REVIEW TRADING FOR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. THE SYSTEMS
AND PROCEDURES USED BY THE FIRM TO MONITOR TRADING FOR OTHER
PURPOSES WERE NOT DESIGNED TO DETECT POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS
ACTIVITY FROM AN AML PERSPECTIVE. AS IT RELATES TO THE FIRM'S
PRIVATE BANKING BUSINESS (PB), THE TRADING ACTIVITY OF A
CUSTOMER, A NEW YORK-BASED HEDGE FUND, ILLUSTRATES THE
DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S SYSTEMS WHEN THAT CUSTOMER'S
TRADING FOLLOWED PATTERNS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH
MICROCAP FRAUD. HOWEVER, NO ONE AT CSSU REVIEWED ACTIVITY IN
THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT FOR AML PURPOSES, AND CSSU DID NOT
EMPLOY AN AUTOMATED SCENARIO DESIGNED TO DETECT THE TYPE OF
POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY ENGAGED IN BY THE CUSTOMER. AS
IT RELATES TO THE FIRM'S INVESTING BANKING BUSINESS (IB), THE FIRM
FAILED TO CONDUCT AN ADEQUATE AML REVIEW OF SALES OF MICROCAP
SECURITIES BY IB CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY MICROCAP SALES ON
BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS OF A CSSU AFFILIATE LOCATED IN A BANK
SECRECY JURISDICTION THAT MAINTAINED AN OMNIBUS ACCOUNT WITH
THE IB. THE TRADING AT ISSUE INCLUDED SUSPICIOUS MICROCAP STOCK
TRANSACTIONS AND SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES. AFTER
SEPTEMBER 30, 2013, CSSU IMPLEMENTED ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES
AND CONTROLS LIMITING THE TRADING OF MICROCAP SECURITIES.
THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT CSSU RELIED ON AN AUTOMATED
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO MONITOR CLIENT ACTIVITY FOR POTENTIALLY
SUSPICIOUS MONEY AND SECURITIES TRANSFERS, USING "SCENARIOS"
THAT THE FIRM CHOSE TO IMPLEMENT. BUT CSSU FAILED TO
EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE SCENARIOS THAT IT CHOSE TO USE, AND IT
FAILED TO IMPLEMENT OTHER AVAILABLE SCENARIOS DESIGNED TO
IDENTIFY SEVERAL OTHER COMMON SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS OR
ACTIVITIES. FURTHER, WHEN ITS SCENARIOS TRIGGERED AN ALERT,
CSSU DID NOT ALWAYS ADEQUATELY REVIEW AND INVESTIGATE THE
ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH CSSU ENGAGED A CONSULTING FIRM IN 2012 TO
EVALUATE ITS AUTOMATED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AND THEN
UNDERTOOK EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THE CONSULTING FIRM'S
RECOMMENDATIONS, SOME OF THE INADEQUACIES IN CSSU'S
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUTOMATED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM REMAIN
OUTSTANDING.
THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH,
MAINTAIN, AND ENFORCE AN ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY SYSTEM,
INCLUDING WSPS, REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE
WITH SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE APPLICABLE
RULES AND REGULATIONS. AS A RESULT, CSSU PARTICIPATED IN CERTAIN
INSTANCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF UNREGISTERED MICROCAP
SECURITIES THROUGH BOTH ITS IB AND ITS PB.
ALSO, CSSU FAILED TO CONDUCT ADEQUATE DUE DILIGENCE ON
CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS (FFIS) THAT WERE ITS AFFILIATES, AND IT FAILED TO

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, CSSU (THE "FIRM")
CONSENTED TO FINRA'S FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND
IMPLEMENT AML POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED
TO CAUSE THE REPORTING OF POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS CUSTOMER
TRADING ACTIVITY. FINRA FOUND THAT THE SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES
USED BY THE FIRM TO MONITOR CUSTOMER TRADING FOR OTHER
PURPOSES DID NOT DETECT POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS TRADING FROM
AN AML PERSPECTIVE. SPECIFICALLY, FINRA POINTED TO TRADING BY
ONE PARTICULAR PRIVATE BANKING ("PB") CUSTOMER FOLLOWING
PATTERNS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH MICROCAP FRAUD AND FOUND
THAT THE PB BUSINESS DID NOT REVIEW THE ACTIVITY, NOR DID AML
COMPLIANCE EMPLOY AN AUTOMATED SCENARIO TO DETECT THIS TYPE
OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. FINRA ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE FIRM FAILED
TO CONDUCT AN ADEQUATE AML REVIEW OF MICROCAP SALES ON
BEHALF OF A FIRM AFFILIATE THAT MAINTAINED AN OMNIBUS ACCOUNT
WITH THE FIRM'S INVESTMENT BANKING ("IB") BUSINESS. THE FINDINGS
ALSO STATE THAT THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT AN
AUTOMATED AML SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO MONITOR CLIENT ACTIVITY;
FAILED TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN AVAILABLE SCENARIOS FOR THE SYSTEM
TO IDENTIFY COMMON SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY; AND DID NOT ALWAYS
ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATE THE ACTIVITY IN THE ALERTS GENERATED BY
THE SYSTEM. FINRA ALSO FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIRM ENGAGED A
CONSULTING FIRM TO REVIEW THIS SYSTEM IN 2012-2013, CERTAIN OF
THE CONSULTANT'S FINDINGS REMAIN OUTSTANDING. IN ADDITION,
FINRA FOUND THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE
SUPERVISORY SYSTEM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 5 OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, RESULTING IN CSSU PARTICIPATING IN
CERTAIN CUSTOMERS' DISTRIBUTIONS OF UNREGISTERED MICROCAP
SHARES IN THE PB AND THE IB. FINALLY, FINRA FOUND THAT THE FIRM
FAILED TO CONDUCT ADEQUATE DUE DILIGENCE AND ENHANCED DUE
DILIGENCE ON CERTAIN FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE
ITS AFFILIATES.

SEC ADMIN RELEASES 33-10013, 34-77002 / JANUARY 31, 2016: THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND
IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED AGAINST
CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC ("CSSU" OR "RESPONDENT"). ON
THE BASIS OF THIS ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S OFFER, THE
COMMISSION FINDS THAT CSSU IS THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF
CROSSFINDER, AN ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEM ("ATS") COMMONLY
REFERRED TO AS A "DARK POOL." CSSU TRANSMITTED CONFIDENTIAL
SUBSCRIBER TRADING INFORMATION FROM CROSSFINDER TO TWO
INTERNAL AES APPLICATIONS THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF CROSSFINDER. IN
THE FIRST APPLICATION, DURING THIS PERIOD, CSSU TRANSMITTED
CROSSFINDER ORDER INFORMATION, AGGREGATED BY PRICE LEVEL, TO
ITS ADVANCED EXECUTION SERVICES SMART ORDER ROUTER (THE "AES
SOR"), AN APPLICATION WHOSE FUNCTION WAS TO DETERMINE WHERE
TO ROUTE ORDERS TRANSMITTED BY CSSU CLIENTS TO CSSU FOR
EXECUTION. IN THE SECOND APPLICATION, CROSSFINDER TRANSMITTED
CONFIDENTIAL SUBSCRIBER TRADING INFORMATION FROM
CROSSFINDER TO A CSSU APPLICATION THAT SENT INDICATIONS OF
INTEREST ("IOIS") TO THE OUTBOUND ROUTERS OF TWO REGISTERED
NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES. THIS APPLICATION (THE "IOI
SERVER") RECEIVED CROSSFINDER CONFIDENTIAL SUBSCRIBER
TRADING INFORMATION AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE IOI
SERVER SENT TO THE OUTBOUND ROUTERS OF THOSE EXCHANGES IOIS
DERIVED FROM CROSSFINDER ORDER INFORMATION CONCERNING "SELL
SIDE" SUBSCRIBERS. BY DEFAULT, IOIS WERE NOT SENT FOR "BUY SIDE"
SUBSCRIBERS. CSSU DID NOT FULLY AND COMPLETELY DISCLOSE TO ALL
CROSSFINDER SUBSCRIBERS THE FACT THAT CONFIDENTIAL ORDER
INFORMATION WAS BEING TRANSMITTED TO THE AES SOR OR TO THE IOI
SERVER. NOR DID CSSU FULLY AND COMPLETELY DISCLOSE TO ALL

SERVER. NOR DID CSSU FULLY AND COMPLETELY DISCLOSE TO ALL
CROSSFINDER SUBSCRIBERS THAT CSSU PROGRAMMED THE IOI SERVER
TO SEND IOIS OUTSIDE OF CSSU FOR SELL SIDE CLIENTS. CSSU ALSO
MADE MISREPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE MANNER IN WHICH
SUBSCRIBERS WERE CATEGORIZED WITHIN CROSSFINDER. CSSU
SOUGHT TO DIFFERENTIATE CROSSFINDER FROM COMPETING ATSS BY
DEVELOPING AND MARKETING A PROPRIETARY METHODOLOGY CALLED
"ALPHA SCORING" THAT PLACED ORDER FLOW FROM SUBSCRIBERS INTO
VARIOUS CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF
THAT TRADING FLOW. FROM DECEMBER 2010 THROUGH MARCH 2014,
ALPHA SCORING WAS NOT PERFORMED AS CSSU HAD REPRESENTED.
ALPHA SCORING IN CROSSFINDER INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT SUBJECTIVE
ELEMENTS. FURTHER, ALPHA SCORING WAS NEITHER TRANSPARENT NOR
WERE ALL CROSSFINDER SUBSCRIBERS CATEGORIZED ON A MONTHLY
BASIS. CSSU MADE MISREPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE MANNER IN
WHICH IT ROUTED CLIENT ORDERS. CSSU TOLD CLIENTS THAT THE AES
SOR DID NOT PREFERENCE CROSSFINDER OR ANY OTHER VENUE WHEN
ROUTING ORDERS WHEN, IN FACT, THE AES SOR SYSTEMATICALLY
PRIORITIZED CROSSFINDER OVER OTHER VENUES IN CERTAIN STAGES
OF THE DARK-ONLY ROUTING PROCESS. CSSU DID NOT DISCLOSE IN ITS
FORM ATS FILING THE FACT THAT CROSSFINDER TRANSMITTED ORDER
INFORMATION TO THE AES SOR, AND DID NOT FILE, AT LEAST 20 DAYS
BEFORE IT IMPLEMENTED THE IOI FUNCTIONALITY, AN AMENDMENT ON
FORM ATS THAT DISCLOSED THE MATERIAL FACTS. CSSU UNREASONABLY
LIMITED ACCESS TO SEVERAL CROSSFINDER FUNCTIONALITIES IN AN
UNFAIR OR DISCRIMINATORY MANNER TO CERTAIN SUBSCRIBERS. CSSU
ALSO DID NOT DISCLOSE AN ARRANGEMENT IT HAD WITH TWO HIGH
FREQUENCY TRADING (HFT) FIRMS THAT, THROUGH A CROSSLINK
TECHNOLOGY, THE AES SOR ROUTED CHILD ORDERS FOR EXECUTION
WITH ORDERS FROM THE HFT FIRMS. THE AES SOR ROUTED CERTAIN
CHILD ORDERS TO CROSSLINK AFTER ENGAGING IN AN EXCHANGE OF
MESSAGES WITH ONE OR THE OTHER HFT FIRM. AS A RESULT OF THE
CONDUCT, CSSU WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 17(A)(2) OF THE
SECURITIES ACT, RULE 301(B)(2) OF REGULATION ATS, RULE 301(B)(5)(II)(B)
OF REGULATION ATS, RULE 301(B)(5)(II)(D) OF REGULATION ATS, RULE

Allegations:

SEC ADMIN RELEASES 33-10014, 34-77003 / JANUARY 31, 2016: THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND
IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED AGAINST
CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC, ("RESPONDENT" OR "CSSU"). ON
THE BASIS OF THIS ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S OFFER, THE
COMMISSION FINDS THAT CSSU IS THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF LIGHT
POOL, AN ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEM ("ATS") AND ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK ("ECN"). CSSU MADE MISREPRESENTATIONS
REGARDING CSSU'S USE AND APPLICATION OF AN "ALPHA
FORMULA/SCORECARD" ("ALPHA FORMULA"), WHICH CSSU USED TO
MEASURE TRADING BY SUBSCRIBERS THAT EXECUTED TRADES IN LIGHT
POOL AND TO DENY DIRECT ACCESS TO SUBSCRIBERS WHOSE TRADING
WAS DETERMINED TO BE "OPPORTUNISTIC." CSSU REPRESENTED TO
EXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS THAT THE ALPHA FORMULA WOULD
BE IN USE WHEN LIGHT POOL BECAME OPERATIONAL. ALTHOUGH LIGHT
POOL WAS FULLY OPERATIONAL FOR TRADING AND WAS TRADING IN NMS
STOCKS BY AT LEAST JUNE 2011, CSSU DID NOT BEGIN APPLYING THE
ALPHA FORMULA UNTIL JUNE 2012. DURING THIS 12-MONTH PERIOD,
CSSU DID NOT CORRECT ITS PREVIOUS STATEMENTS AND DID NOT
INFORM MOST SUBSCRIBERS THAT THE ALPHA FORMULA HAD NOT BEEN
FINALIZED AND WAS NOT IN USE. CSSU ALSO REPRESENTED TO CLIENTS
AND PROSPECTIVE SUBSCRIBERS THAT ALL LIGHT POOL
"PARTICIPANTS," "TRADERS," OR "CLIENTS," INCLUDING HIGH
FREQUENCY TRADING FIRMS ("HFTS"), WHO WERE CLASSIFIED AS
OPPORTUNISTIC WOULD BE "KICKED OUT" OF OR "LOSE ACCESS TO"
LIGHT POOL OTHER THAN ACCESSING IT THROUGH THE NATIONAL STOCK
EXCHANGE ("NSX"). CSSU'S REPRESENTATIONS WERE NOT ACCURATE
BECAUSE CSSU DID NOT APPLY THE ALPHA FORMULA TO A SUBSCRIBER'S
TRADING

"PARTICIPANTS," "TRADERS," OR "CLIENTS," INCLUDING HIGH
FREQUENCY TRADING FIRMS ("HFTS"), WHO WERE CLASSIFIED AS
OPPORTUNISTIC WOULD BE "KICKED OUT" OF OR "LOSE ACCESS TO"
LIGHT POOL OTHER THAN ACCESSING IT THROUGH THE NATIONAL STOCK
EXCHANGE ("NSX"). CSSU'S REPRESENTATIONS WERE NOT ACCURATE
BECAUSE CSSU DID NOT APPLY THE ALPHA FORMULA TO A SUBSCRIBER'S
TRADING AS A WHOLE, BUT INSTEAD APPLIED IT SEPARATELY TO THE
ORDER FLOW SUBMITTED UNDER EACH SYSTEM ID OF A SUBSCRIBER.
ALTHOUGH CSSU SUSPENDED FROM LIGHT POOL THE FEW DIRECT
SUBSCRIBERS WHO WERE CATEGORIZED AS "OPPORTUNISTIC," THEY
WERE NOT "KICKED OUT" BECAUSE CSSU ALLOWED THEM TO RESUME
DIRECT TRADING IN LIGHT POOL IF THEY REPRESENTED THAT THEY
WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIGHT POOL TRADING, AND
THEY COULD ALSO TRADE DIRECTLY IN LIGHT POOL THROUGH OTHER
SYSTEM IDS. DIRECT SUBSCRIBERS WERE ALSO GIVEN THE
OPPORTUNITY TO ADJUST THEIR TRADING TO AVOID BEING LABELED AS
"OPPORTUNISTIC." IN CONTRAST, CSSU DID KICK OUT SEVERAL INDIRECT
SUBSCRIBERS, WHO ACCESSED LIGHT POOL VIA CSSU ALGORITHMS AND
CSSU'S ADVANCED EXECUTION SERVICES (AES) SMART ORDER ROUTER
(AES SOR). INDIRECT SUBSCRIBERS ALSO WERE NOT GIVEN THE
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIGHT POOL TRADING
TO AVOID BEING LABELED AS "OPPORTUNISTIC." CSSU DID NOT DISCLOSE
IN ITS FORMS ATS AND ATS-R THAT THE ALPHA FORMULA WAS NOT
APPLIED FROM JULY 2011 THROUGH JUNE 2012. CSSU ALSO
INACCURATELY REPRESENTED IN ITS FORMS ATS THAT SUBSCRIBERS
WHOSE ORDER FLOW WAS IDENTIFIED AS OPPORTUNISTIC WOULD BE
SUSPENDED BUT COULD REGAIN DIRECT ACCESS TO LIGHT POOL AFTER
MAKING CHANGES TO THE QUALITY OF THEIR ORDER FLOW. CSSU ALSO
DID NOT UPDATE ITS FORMS ATS TO DISCLOSE THE DIFFERENCES IN
HOW THE ALPHA FORMULA WAS APPLIED TO DIRECT AND INDIRECT
SUBSCRIBERS, INCLUDING IN THEIR ABILITY TO REGAIN ACCESS TO LIGHT
POOL. CSSU ALSO DID NOT TIMELY UPDATE ITS FORM ATS TO REFLECT
CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE APPLICATION OF THE ALPHA FORMULA THAT
WERE FIRST IMPLEMENTED IN THE FALL OF 2012. FINALLY, FROM
JANUARY 2011 THROUGH APRIL 1, 2013, CSSU "BACKED AWAY" FROM
LIGHT POOL QUOTES THAT IT DISPLAYED ON THE NSX USING THE ORDER
DELIVERY FUNCTIONALITY OFFERED BY NSX. CSSU DID NOT EXECUTE
THOSE AFTER THEY WERE MATCHED ON NSX BASED ON NATIONAL BEST
BID AND OFFER ("NBBO") CHECKS THAT CSSU CONDUCTED EVEN THOUGH
NSX ALREADY HAD PERFORMED SUCH CHECKS. AS A RESULT OF THE
CONDUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE, CSSU WILLFULLY VIOLATED: SECTION
17(A)(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT; RULE 301(B)(2) OF REGULATIONS ATS;
AND RULE 602(B) OF REGULATION NMS.

ON DECEMBER 14, 2012, CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC (CSSU)
OPERATED AN AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEM ("ATS") THAT
MALFUNCTIONED AND CAUSED AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF ORDERS AND
CANCEL MESSAGES TO BE ENTERED IN THE MARCH 2013 TWO-YEAR
FUTURES CONTRACT ON THE GLOBEX ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM.
ALTHOUGH CSSU BECAME AWARE OF THE MALFUNCTION IMMEDIATELY, IT
ALLOWED THE ATS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE FOR 90 MINUTES WHILE
ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE AND RECTIFY THE PROBLEM.
DURING THOSE 90 MINUTES, THE ATS ACCOUNTED FOR 88% OF THE
MESSAGING VOLUME IN THE CONTRACT. CSSU ULTIMATELY
DEACTIVATED THE ATS ONLY AFTER THE EXCHANGE CONTRACTED THE
FIRM REGARDING THE MESSAGING ACTIVITY.

EFFORTS OF THE COMPANY'S PLANNED INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO).
THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE EQUITY
OWNERS INVITED CREDIT SUISSE AND OTHER BROKER-DEALERS TO
COMPETE FOR A ROLE IN THE COMPANY'S IPO. CREDIT SUISSE ALLOWED
ITS RESEARCH ANALYST TO PRESENT HIS VIEWS ON THE COMPANY TO
ITS MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS. BEFORE THE COMPANY

RISK AND EXPOSURE IN ORDER TO TRADE FUTURES ON CME GLOBEX.
ON JANUARY 31, 2012, THE STOCK PRICE OF AN UNDERLYING
COMPONENT OF AN INDEX WAS QUOTED INCORRECTLY BY A THIRDPARTY VENDOR, CAUSING ERRANT CALCULATIONS IN DETERMINING THE
NUMBER OF FUTURES CONTRACTS TO BE TRADED BY THE ATS. THE

EXECUTE BUY AND SELL ORDERS OF VARYING SIZES IN MARCH 2012 EMINI S&P AND MARCH 2012 E-MINI NASDAQ FUTURES CONTRACTS. THESE

SEC ADMIN RELEASES 33-9368, 34-68251, NOVEMBER 16, 2012: THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("COMMISSION") DEEMED IT
APPROPRIATE THAT CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933 ("SECURITIES ACT") AND SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 ("EXCHANGE ACT"), AGAINST CREDIT SUISSE
SECURITIES (USA) LLC AND OTHER AFFILIATED ENTITIES
("RESPONDENTS").
THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT THE MATTER INVOLVES TWO SEPARATE
PRACTICES IN WHICH CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC,
AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES (COLLECTIVELY, "CREDIT SUISSE") ENGAGED
WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED
SECURITIES ("RMBS") IT SPONSORED AND/OR UNDERWROTE.

FIRST, FROM APPROXIMATELY 2005 TO 2010, CREDIT SUISSE ENTERED
INTO A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL SETTLEMENTS WITH LOAN ORIGINATORS
RELATED TO EARLY DEFAULTING LOANS IT HAD PREVIOUSLY SOLD TO
SECURITIZATION TRUSTS IT SPONSORED, AND THEN KEPT THE
PROCEEDS OF THOSE SETTLEMENTS WITHOUT NOTIFYING OR
COMPENSATING THE RMBS TRUSTS THAT OWNED THE LOANS (THE "BULK
SETTLEMENT" PRACTICE). CREDIT SUISSE FAILED TO DISCLOSE THIS
PRACTICE TO ITS RMBS INVESTORS. ADDITIONALLY, WITH RESPECT TO

PROCEEDS OF THOSE SETTLEMENTS WITHOUT NOTIFYING OR
COMPENSATING THE RMBS TRUSTS THAT OWNED THE LOANS (THE "BULK

PRACTICE TO ITS RMBS INVESTORS. ADDITIONALLY, WITH RESPECT TO
CERTAIN RMBS TRANSACTIONS, CREDIT SUISSE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH
OFFERING DOCUMENT PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRED IT TO REPURCHASE
CERTAIN EARLY DEFAULTING LOANS. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT,
CREDIT SUISSE
IMPROPERLY OBTAINED APPROXIMATELY $55,747,769.

User Guidance

SEPARATELY, IN LATE 2006, CREDIT SUISSE UNDERWROTE TWO RMBS
TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE COLLATERALIZED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.9
BILLION OF SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS EFFORTS
TO MARKET AND SELL THESE RMBS, CREDIT SUISSE MADE MISLEADING
STATEMENTS REGARDING A KEY INVESTOR PROTECTION KNOWN AS THE
"FIRST PAYMENT DEFAULT" ("FPD") COVENANT, WHICH REQUIRED THE
ORIGINATORS OF THE LOANS TO REPURCHASE CERTAIN DELINQUENT
LOANS OR OTHERWISE CURE BREACHES OF THE COVENANT. IF THE
ORIGINATORS WERE NOTIFIED OF AND SUBSEQUENTLY FAILED TO
REPURCHASE OR CURE A BREACH OF THE FPD COVENANT WITHIN THE
MEANING OF THE POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENTS ("PSAS"),
CREDIT SUISSE WAS REQUIRED TO DO SO. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS
PROVISION, CREDIT SUISSE, WITHOUT DISCLOSURE, DID NOT ENSURE
THE REMOVAL OF ALL SUCH LOANS. AS A RESULT, INVESTORS SUSTAINED
LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $10,056,561 ON THE LOANS THAT
IMPROPERLY REMAINED IN THE RMBS TRUSTS.
AS A RESULT OF THE NEGLIGENT CONDUCT, CREDIT SUISSE VIOLATED
SECTION 17(A)(2) AND (3) OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

THE FIRM VIOLATED THE LOCATE REQUIREMENT ON AN ONGOING BASIS
ACROSS MANY OF ITS TRADING SYSTEMS, AGGREGATION UNITS AND
DESKS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THE FIRM IMPROPERLY
PROGRAMMED THE TRADING SYSTEMS USED BY ITS AGGREGATION
UNITS SO THAT SHORT SALE ORDERS COULD BE ENTERED FOR A
NUMBER OF SHARES IN EXCESS OF THE LOCATE GRANTED AND SO THAT
LOCATED SHARES AVAILABLE WERE NOT DECREASED TO ACCOUNT FOR
SHORT SALE ORDERS LIVE IN THE MARKET BUT UNEXECUTED. INSTEAD,
THESE TRADING SYSTEMS DECREASED THE LOCATED SHARES AVAILABLE
ONLY BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXECUTED AS THE RESULT OF SHORT
SALE ORDERS. THE RESULT OF THIS PROGRAMMING WAS THAT EACH OF
THESE AGGREGATION UNITS ENTERED AND HAD OPEN IN THE MARKET
SHORT SALE ORDERS THAT, SINGULARLY OR JOINTLY, EXCEEDED
AVAILABLE LOCATED SHARES. AS A RESULT, SHORT SALES WERE
EXECUTED WITHOUT A VALID LOCATE. ONLY AFTER FINRA IDENTIFIED
NUMEROUS UNEXPLAINED SHORT SALE VIOLATIONS DID THE FIRM
CORRECT THIS VIOLATIVE USE OF LOCATES. THE TRADING SYSTEMS
USED BY THE FIRM'S AGGREGATION UNITS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE WHEN
A LOCATE REQUEST HAD BEEN REJECTED. DUE TO A DELAY IN THE

UNIT IMPROPERLY USED THE PRIOR DAY'S APPROVAL LIST AS THE BASIS
FOR SHORT SALE LOCATES. ORDER ENTRY SYSTEMS UTILIZED BY THE
FIRM'S AGGREGATION UNITS DID NOT HAVE THE FUNCTIONALITY TO
AUTOMATICALLY BLOCK OR STOP A SHORT SALE ORDER FROM BEING

EXIST AT THE TIME OF ORDER ENTRY. IN ADDITION THE FIRM'S

ON THE OPTIONS DESK IN THE DERIVATIVES AGGREGATION UNIT TO
ENTER ORDERS THROUGH A THIRD-PARTY TRADING SYSTEM, WHICH DID
NOT REQUIRE THE ENTRY OF LOCATE INFORMATION IN CONNECTION
WITH SHORT SALE ORDERS. THE FIRM WAS AWARE AT THE TIME THE
TRADING SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED THAT IT INCLUDED A FUNCTIONALITY
THAT PERMITTED THE ENTRY OF SHORT SALES WITHOUT LOCATES YET
TOOK NO ACTION TO DETERMINE WHETHER LOCATES WERE OBTAINED IN
CONNECTION WITH SHORT SALES ENTERED THROUGH THIS SYSTEM
UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2009. THE FIRM FAILED TO DEVELOP FUNCTIONAL
POST-TRADE REPORTS OR ANY OTHER REVIEW SYSTEM FOR ITS ENTIRE

FIRM FAILED TO PUT IN PLACE REASONABLE AND EFFECTIVE POSTTRADE EXCEPTION REPORTS TO REVIEW SHORT SALE ORDERS ENTERED
BY MULTIPLE AGGREGATION UNITS, TRADING DESKS AND TRADERS TO
DETERMINE WHETHER A VALID LOCATE HAD BEEN OBTAINED. THE FIRM
MISAPPLIED AN EXCEPTION TO THE LOCATE REQUIREMENT BY
IMPROPERLY TREATING SHORT SALES IN CERTAIN SECURITIES AS
EXCEPTIONS TO THE LOCATE REQUIREMENT. THE FIRM INCORRECTLY
DESIGNATED IN ITS SYSTEMS THAT IT WAS A MARKET MAKER IN
NUMEROUS SECURITIES, WHEN IT WAS NOT A MARKET-MAKER IN THOSE
SECURITIES. THE FIRM FAILED TO ADEQUATELY DOCUMENT LOCATES
WHEN ITS PROGRAM TRADING UNIT/DESK ENTERED SHORT SALE HEDGE
ORDERS FOR ITS PRIME SERVICES CLIENT DESK WITHOUT

HAD BEEN OBTAINED OR THE TIME WHEN THE LOCATE HAD BEEN

CANCELLED AND REPLACED THE ORIGINAL ORDER TO INCREASE ITS
SIZE. THE CASH/BLOCK DESK MISMARKED SHORT SALES AS LONG SALES

THE FIRM WAS UNABLE TO QUANTIFY THE NUMBER OF SHORT SALE

INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING HEDGE FUNDS AND FUNDS OF HEDGE FUNDS,
TO CUSTOMERS. FUNDS OF HEDGE FUNDS ARE INVESTMENT COMPANIES
THAT MAY BE REGISTERED CLOSED-END FUNDS OR UNREGISTERED

PRIMARILY TO HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT
MET THE ACCREDITED INVESTOR STANDARD AS DEFINED BY THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND/OR THE QUALIFIED PURCHASER STANDARD
UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940.
PBUSA RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS USED A MARKETING PITCH BOOK TO
MARKET THE FIRM ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING
HEDGE FUNDS AND FUNDS OF HEDGE FUNDS, TO CUSTOMERS AND
PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS.

THE PITCH BOOK'S PURPOSE WAS TO INTRODUCE QUALIFIED, HIGH NET
WORTH CUSTOMERS AND PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS TO, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE VARIOUS TYPES OF HEDGE FUNDS AND FUNDS OF HEDGE
FUNDS OFFERED BY THE FIRM. THE PITCH BOOK DESCRIBED IN GENERAL
TERMS THE BENEFITS OF THE VARIOUS PRODUCT CATEGORIES FOR
PBUSA CUSTOMERS, CONTAINED A DISCUSSION OF HEDGE FUNDS AS
PART OF AN OVERALL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PROVIDED BRIEF
OVERVIEW INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN REPRESENTATIVE OFFERINGS,
DESCRIBED THE GENERAL DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS AT THE FIRM, AND
CONTAINED A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT
OFFERINGS AT THE FIRM. THE PITCH BOOK WAS OFTEN USED BY PBUSA
REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES TO GUIDE THEIR DISCUSSIONS AT
INTRODUCTORY PRESENTATIONS WITH PROSPECTIVE OR EXISTING
CUSTOMERS AND TO DESCRIBE THE FIRM'S OFFERINGS OF AND
CAPABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. THE PITCH
BOOK CONTAINED A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS REGARDING THE FIRM'S
DUE DILIGENCE EFFORTS. IN PARTICULAR, DURING THE PERIOD FROM

FURTHER, THE FIRM FAILED TO NAME OR DEFINE THE METHODOLOGY IT
USED TO CALCULATE THE MORTGAGE DELINQUENCY RATES FOR FIVE
SUBPRIME RMBS IT UNDERWROTE AND SOLD IN 2006, AS REQUIRED BY

IS APPROXIMATELY $5,673,200,250. SINCE THE DELINQUENCY FIGURES

**11/27/2009**DECISION 09-NYSE-24 ISSUED BY NYSE HEARING
BOARD.CONSENTED TO FINDINGS:THE FIRM FAILED TO ADHERE TO THE
PRINCIPLES OF GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE, IN VIOLATION OF NYSE RULE
401, IN THAT ON NOVEMBER 14, 2007 A CREDIT SUISSE PROPRIETARY
ALGORITHM ROUTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CANCEL/REPLACE
REQUESTS TO THE NYSE FOR ORDERS THAT HAD NEVER BEEN SENT BY
THE ALGORITHM. THE UNUSUALLY LARGE AMOUNT OF CANCEL/REPLACE
MESSAGES CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVER-QUEUING OF MESSAGE TRAFFIC
IN ALL OF THE SECURITIES TRADED AT FIVE POSTS ON THE NYSE
FLOOR.MESSAGES,INCLUDING NEW ORDERS, MODIFICATIONS OF
ORDERS, AND CANCELLATION REQUESTS WERE FROZEN IN QUEUE AND
COULD NOT BE IMMEDIATELY PROCESSED. THESE FIVE POSTS COULD
NOT BE CLOSED ON TIME, ULTIMATELY CLOSING BETWEEN 4:10 P.M. AND
4:27 P.M. THE FIRM ALSO VIOLATED NYSE RULE 342 BY FAILING TO
PROPERLY SUPERVISE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
FIRM'S PROPRIETARY ALGORITHM, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO
CERTAIN REVISIONS TO THE ALGORITHM THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE
NOVEMBER 14TH INCIDENT. THE FIRM ALSO FAILED TO PROPERLY
MONITOR THE OPERATION OF THE ALGORITHM, AS EVIDENCED BY THE
FACT THAT THE FIRM WAS UNAWARE THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF MESSAGES SENT BY THE ALGORITHM WERE BEING REJECTED BY
NYSE SYSTEMS UNTIL BEING NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE BY NYSE
REGULATION THE FOLLOWING DAY. STIPULATED SANCTION:CENSURE AND
A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF 150,000

ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2003, THE BANKING COMMISSIONER ENTERED A
CONSENT ORDER (DOCKET NO. CO-2003-6796-S) WITH RESPECT TO
CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LLC. THE AGENCY INVESTIGATION
CULMINATING IN THE ENTRY OF THE CONSENT ORDER FOCUSED ON THE
FIRM'S RESEARCH PRACTICES FOR THE PERIOD 1998 THROUGH 2001,
AND WAS PART OF SIMILAR INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY A MULTISTATE TASK FORCE AND A JOINT TASK FORCE OF THE SEC, THE NEW
YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS. THE GLOBAL RESOLUTION CAPPING THE
INVESTIGATIONS RESULTED IN $75 MILLION ALLOCATED TO THE STATES;
$75 MILLION REPRESENTING THE DISGORGEMENT OF COMMISSIONS AND
FEES; AND $50 MILLION TO BE EARMARKED FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH BY THE RESPONDENT. THE RESPONDENT
ALSO AGREED TO ABIDE BY CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS DESIGNED TO
SEPARATE INVESTMENT BANKING AND RESEARCH FUNCTIONS.
IN ENTERING THE CONSENT ORDER, THE COMMISSIONER FOUND THAT
THE RESPONDENT HAD 1) VIOLATED SECTION 36B-4(A)(2) OF THE ACT BY
ISSUING FALSE AND MISLEADING RESEARCH REPORTS; 2) VIOLATED
SECTION 36B-4(B) OF THE ACT BY ENGAGING IN DISHONEST OR
UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND 3) FAILED TO ESTABLISH,
ENFORCE AND MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY SYSTEM TO

Regulator Statement

CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION ("CSFB") STIPULATED TO
THE FOLLOWING CONDUCT: ON MAY 22, 2001, A CSFB UPSTAIRS FIRM
TRADER ("FIRM TRADER"), WHILE ACTING ON BEHALF OF CSFB, AND
HOLDING A CUSTOMER ORDER ("ORIGINAL ORDER") TO SELL 3000
NASDAQ-100? INDEX TRACKING STOCK ("QQQ") JUN 49 CALLS AND BUY
4000 QQQ JUN 52 CALLS ("RATIO CALL SPREAD"), REQUESTED A MARKET
FOR THE RATIO CALL SPREAD FROM THE CBOE QQQ TRADING CROWD.
THE CBOE QQQ TRADING CROWD PROVIDED TO THE INDEPENDENT
BROKER REPRESENTING CSFB A MARKET OF A NET CREDIT PRICE OF $3
AND THE INDEPENDENT BROKER INFORMED CSFB THAT CSFB COULD
NOT CROSS THE RATIO CALL SPREAD WITH A SOLICITED SPREAD ORDER
WITH LEGS HAVING AN EFFECTIVE NET CREDIT PRICE OF $2.90. CSFB
SUBSEQUENTLY ALLOWED THE RATIO CALL SPREAD TO BE TRADED AT
THE PHILADELPHIA STOCK EXCHANGE (?PHLX?) AT A NET CREDIT PRICE
OF $2.90. A PORTION OF THE RATIO CALL SPREAD WAS CROSSED WITH A
SOLICITED BROKER/DEALER ORDER. THE ORIGINAL ORDER RECEIVED A
LESS FAVORABLE PRICE ($30,000) THAN COULD HAVE BEEN OBTAINED AT
THE CBOE. AS A RESULT, CSFB FAILED TO EXERCISE DUE DILIGENCE IN
HANDLING THE ORIGINAL ORDER TO SELL THE RATIO CALL SPREAD,
WHEREBY AFTER SOLICITING FROM THE CBOE QQQ TRADING CROWD A
MARKET AND THE CROWD MAKING A MARKET OF A NET CREDIT PRICE OF
$3, CSFB SUBSEQUENTLY ALLOWED THE RATIO CALL SPREAD TO BE
TRADED AT THE PHLX AT A NET CREDIT PRICE OF $2.90. A PORTION OF
THE RATIO CALL SPREAD WAS CROSSED WITH A SOLICITED
BROKER/DEALER ORDER. AS A RESULT, THE ORIGINAL ORDER RECEIVED
A LESS FAVORABLE PRICE ($30,000) THAN COULD HAVE BEEN OBTAINED
AT THE CBOE. (CBOE RULE 4.1.)

Sanction Details:

CS First Boston Corporation was censured and
fined a total of $450,000 to be paid jointly to the CBOE and
the NYSE. Further, CS First Boston is required to comply with
the undertaking to retain an outside consultant, not
unacceptable to the CBOE and NYSE, to conduct a review and
prepare a report of the firm's systems and procedures and make
recommendationns for additional systems and procedures, if
necessary, reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the
federal securities laws and CBOE rules and to prevent
recurrence of the following violations. The firm must submit
the report with respect to such review, recommendations and
adoption of recommendations to the CBOE.

Regulator Statement

Without admitting or denying any allegations,
facts, conclusions or findings, CS First Boston stipulated that
it violated a CBOE rule by failing to provide for, establish,
maintain and implement appropriate procedures of supervision
and control, including a separate system of follow-up and
review of the business activities and operations of the firm's
Program Trading Desk and employees to prevent rule violations,
including but not limited to, preventing the inaccurate and
incomplete submission of Daily Program Trading REports to the
NYSE and detecting and preventing the entry on June 18, 1993 of
MOC purchase orders for more than 34 million shares that were
valued at approximately $1.5 billion and the cancellation of
these orders when there was no reasonable basis to enter orders
of such magnitude nor any reasonable expectation that such
orders would be executed. The firm further stipulated that it
violated certain federal securities laws and CBOE rules on June
18, 1993 with respect to certain option orders on the CBOE. The
firm failed to prepare or maintain records of orders, failed to
record the time of entry and the time at which execution report
were received and failed to record modifications to orders.
Also, the firm entered and caused to be executed MOC sell
orders for S&P 100 (OEX), S&P 500 (SPX) and Major Market Index
(XMI) component stocks in which the firm held net short
positions, where such orders were not marked short and were
executed at the close of trading on the NYSE in numerous
instances at prices which were on minus or on zero-minus ticks.

SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 21457, MARCH 19, 2010: THE HONORABLE
JUDGE OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ISSUED AN ORDER ON MARCH 15, 2010
APPROVING MODIFICATIONS TO THE FINAL JUDGMENTS ENTERED
AGAINST THE DEFENDANT AND OTHERS. THE FINAL JUDGMENTS
CONTAINED AN EXTENSIVE ADDENDUM WITH PROVISIONS MANDATING
STRUCTURAL AND OTHER REFORMS THAT ADDRESSED POTENTIAL
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND
INVESTMENT BANKING. THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDED THAT WITH
RESPECT TO ANY PROVISION THAT HAD NOT BEEN EXPRESSLY
SUPERSEDED BY SUBSEQUENT RULEMAKING WITHIN FIVE YEARS, THE
SEC WOULD AGREE TO AN AMENDMENT/MODIFICATION OF SUCH TERM,
SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL, UNLESS THE SEC BELIEVES IT WOULD
NOT BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THE COURT APPROVED REMOVING A
NUMBER OF PROVISIONS. THE ADDENDUM NO LONGER INCLUDES
PROHIBITIONS AGAINST INVESTMENT BANKING INPUT INTO RESEARCH
ANALYST COMPENSATION AND THE BAR AGAINST RESEARCH ANALYSTS
PARTICIPATING IN EFFORTS TO SOLICIT INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS,
AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE MODIFIED ADDENDUM AS ORDERED BY THE
COURT AND SUPPORTED BY THE SEC MAINTAINED THE REQUIREMENT
THAT A CHAPERONE FROM LEGAL OR COMPLIANCE BE PRESENT WHEN
INVESTMENT BANKING SEEKS THE VIEWS OF RESEARCH ANALYSTS
CONCERNING A PROPOSED TRANSACTION OR A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE
FOR A TRANSACTION. ONE PROPOSED MODIFICATION WOULD HAVE
ALLOWED INVESTMENT BANKING TO SEEK THE VIEWS OF RESEARCH
ANALYSTS REGARDING MARKET OR INDUSTRY TRENDS, CONDITIONS, OR
DEVELOPMENTS WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENT OF A CHAPERONE,
SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS INCLUDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
CONTROLS AND TRAINING AS DESCRIBED IN THE NOVEMBER 30, 2009
LETTER TO THE COURT FROM THE SETTLING FIRMS. IN HIS MARCH 15,
2010 ORDER, THE HONORABLE JUDGE DID NOT APPROVE THIS

THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE USD ICE LIBOR RATE FROM 2014 TO
THE PRESENT HAS COLLUSIVELY BEEN SET ARTIFICIALLY LOW BY ALL
DEFENDANTS, WHO INCLUDE THE PANEL BANKS AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES
AND ICE AND ITS AFFILIATES. PLAINTIFF ALLEGES A "PROFIT-MOTIVATED
CONSPIRACY" TO SET USD ICE LIBOR LOWER SO THAT THE PANEL BANK
DEFENDANTS COULD MAKE LOWER INTEREST PAYMENTS ON FLOATING
RATE NOTES AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS. IN ADDITION TO THE MOTIVE,
PLAINTIFF CONTENDS THAT DEFENDANTS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO
CONSPIRE THROUGH THE ICE PROCESS AND RECIDIVISM (ALLEGED
MISCONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO LIBOR RATES IN THE PAST) SUPPORTS
THE PRESENT CONSPIRACY. PLAINTIFF ALSO ASSERTS THAT ICE AND THE
PANEL BANK DEFENDANTS FURTHERED THE CONSPIRACY BY
CONCEALING THE "LACK OF INTERBANK FUNDING UNDERLYING USD ICE
LIBOR DURING THE CLASS PERIOD." TO SET ICE LIBOR, THE PANEL
BANKS WERE INSTRUCTED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION: "AT WHAT RATE
COULD YOU BORROW FUNDS, WERE YOU TO DO SO BY ASKING FOR AND
THEN ACCEPTING INTERBANK OFFERS IN A REASONABLE MARKET SIZE
JUST PRIOR TO 11AM?" PLAINTIFF ASSERTS THAT TO ANSWER OR EVEN
ASK THIS QUESTION SUGGESTED THE EXISTENCE OF AN ACTIVE
"INTERBANK" FUNDING MARKET; HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SUCH
UNDERLYING MARKET, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS. PLAINTIFF HAS
ASSERTED TWO CLAIMS: ONE FOR PRICE-FIXING UNDER THE SHERMAN
ACT AND ONE FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT, BOTH PURPORTEDLY ON
BEHALF OF A CLASS OF ALL PERSONS OR ENTITIES RESIDING IN THE
UNITED STATES THAT DIRECTLY TRANSACTED WITH A PANEL BANK
DEFENDANT IN AN ICE LIBOR-LINKED FLOATING RATE DEBT INSTRUMENT
OR SWAP DURING THE CLASS PERIOD. CITY OF LIVONIA HAS NOT
ALLEGED ANY SPECIFIC TRADES WITH CREDIT SUISSE, AND THERE ARE
NO CREDIT SUISSE-SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS OTHER THAN ICE LIBOR
SUBMISSION DATA AND RELATED STATISTICS.
