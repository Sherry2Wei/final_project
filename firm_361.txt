What is included in a BrokerCheck report?
BrokerCheck reports for individual brokers include information such as employment history, professional
qualifications, disciplinary actions, criminal convictions, civil judgments and arbitration awards. BrokerCheck
reports for brokerage firms include information on a firm’s profile, history, and operations, as well as many of the
same disclosure events mentioned above.
Please note that the information contained in a BrokerCheck report may include pending actions or
allegations that may be contested, unresolved or unproven. In the end, these actions or allegations may be
resolved in favor of the broker or brokerage firm, or concluded through a negotiated settlement with no
admission or finding of wrongdoing.
Where did this information come from?
The information contained in BrokerCheck comes from FINRA’s Central Registration Depository, or
CRD® and is a combination of:
o information FINRA and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) require brokers and
brokerage firms to submit as part of the registration and licensing process, and
o information that regulators report regarding disciplinary actions or allegations against firms or brokers.
How current is this information?
Generally, active brokerage firms and brokers are required to update their professional and disciplinary
information in CRD within 30 days. Under most circumstances, information reported by brokerage firms, brokers
and regulators is available in BrokerCheck the next business day.
What if I want to check the background of an investment adviser firm or investment adviser
representative?
To check the background of an investment adviser firm or representative, you can search for the firm or
individual in BrokerCheck. If your search is successful, click on the link provided to view the available licensing
and registration information in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website at
https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. In the alternative, you may search the IAPD website directly or contact your
state securities regulator at http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/P455414.
Are there other resources I can use to check the background of investment professionals?
FINRA recommends that you learn as much as possible about an investment professional before
deciding to work with them. Your state securities regulator can help you research brokers and investment adviser
representatives doing business in your state.

Disclosure Event Details
What you should know about reported disclosure events:
1. BrokerCheck provides details for any disclosure event that was reported in CRD. It also includes
summary information regarding FINRA arbitration awards in cases where the brokerage firm was
named as a respondent.
2. Certain thresholds must be met before an event is reported to CRD, for example:
o A law enforcement agency must file formal charges before a brokerage firm is required to disclose a
particular criminal event.
3. Disclosure events in BrokerCheck reports come from different sources:
o Disclosure events for this brokerage firm were reported by the firm and/or regulators. When the firm
and a regulator report information for the same event, both versions of the event will appear in the
BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source
labeled.
4. There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:
o A disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, or final.
§ A "pending" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated.
§ An event that is "on appeal" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently
being appealed.
§ A "final" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.
o A final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled or otherwise resolved.
§ An "adjudicated" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter,
or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party
charged with some alleged wrongdoing.
§ A "settled" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter.
Please note that firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for
business or other reasons.
§ A "resolved" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of
wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker. Such matters generally involve customer
disputes.
5. You may wish to contact the brokerage firm to obtain further information regarding any of the
disclosure events contained in this BrokerCheck report.

Regulatory - Final
This type of disclosure event involves (1) a final, formal proceeding initiated by a regulatory authority (e.g., a state
securities agency, self-regulatory organization, federal regulator such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
foreign financial regulatory body) for a violation of investment-related rules or regulations; or (2) a revocation or
suspension of the authority of a brokerage firm or its control affiliate to act as an attorney, accountant or federal
contractor.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
DELIVER NUMEROUS EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (ETFS) PROSPECTUSES
THAT THE FIRM INTENDED TO DELIVER DUE TO THREE SEPARATE FLAWS
IN THE FIRM'S PROSPECTUS-DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE FINDINGS STATED
THAT SECTION 5(B)(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 PROHIBITS SUCH
CONDUCT. THE FIRM CLEARED OVER 100 MILLION ETF PURCHASES FOR
ITS OWN CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY INSTITUTIONAL MARKET PARTICIPANTS,
AND FOR CUSTOMERS OF OVER 100 INTRODUCING BROKERS. THE FIRM
DESIGNED A SYSTEM TO DELIVER PROSPECTUSES FOR ALL FIRST-TIME
ETF PURCHASES REGARDLESS OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO DELIVER
PROSPECTUSES OR THE AVAILABILITY OF EXEMPTIONS. HOWEVER, DUE
TO CERTAIN DESIGN FLAWS, THE FIRM'S PROSPECTUS DELIVERY SYSTEM
FAILED TO DELIVER NUMEROUS ETF PROSPECTUSES. THE FIRM'S
PROSPECTUS-DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS ALSO INADEQUATELY TESTED AND
IT FAILED TO DISCOVER THE ISSUE DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. THE

PROSPECTUS-DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS ALSO INADEQUATELY TESTED AND
IT FAILED TO DISCOVER THE ISSUE DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. THE
PRIMARY SYSTEM FLAW OCCURRED WHEN TO PROTECT CUSTOMER
INFORMATION, THE FIRM STOPPED USING TAXPAYER ID NUMBERS IN ITS
TRADE-PROCESSING SYSTEMS. BUT BECAUSE THE FIRM DID NOT
REPLACE TAXPAYER ID NUMBERS WITH ANOTHER UNIQUE CUSTOMERIDENTIFIER, THE FIELD FOR TAXPAYER ID NUMBERS WAS LEFT BLANK,
CAUSING THE SYSTEM TO TREAT ALL TRANSACTIONS IN THE SAME ETF
CUSIP ON THE SAME DAY AS INVOLVING A SINGLE CUSTOMER,
EFFECTIVELY EXCLUDING FROM PROSPECTUS-DELIVERY
CONSIDERATIONS ALL OTHER CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED THAT ETF
THAT DAY. FINRA INQUIRED WITH THE FIRM ABOUT FAILURES WITH
RESPECT TO ITS PROSPECTUS DELIVERY. THE FIRM INVESTIGATED AND
ONLY THEN CORRECTED THIS FLAW BY USING CUSTOMERS' ACCOUNT
NUMBERS AS A UNIQUE CUSTOMER IDENTIFIER IN ITS ETF PROSPECTUSDELIVERY SYSTEM. THE SECOND FLAW IN THE FIRM'S PROSPECTUSDELIVERY SYSTEM OCCURRED WHEN WITH CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL
ACCOUNTS THE FIRM USED A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR TO MAIL
PROSPECTUSES TO CUSTOMERS. DUE TO AN OPERATIONAL ERROR,
HOWEVER, THE FIRM REPEATEDLY SENT THE MAILING LABELS FOR
THESE CUSTOMERS TO THE WRONG PRINTING QUEUE. AS A RESULT,
PROSPECTUSES MAILING LABELS WERE NOT PRINTED AND NOT
DELIVERED. THE FIRM'S SYSTEM WAS TO ISSUE ALERTS OF
UNSUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF PRINT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE VENDOR
BUT THE SYSTEM GENERATED NO ALERTS. THE THIRD FLAW IN THE
FIRM'S PROSPECTUS-DELIVERY SYSTEM OCCURRED WHEN THE FIRM'S
SYSTEM DID NOT CONSIDER WHETHER THERE WERE CHANGES OR
UPDATES TO AN ETF PROSPECTUS SINCE A CUSTOMER'S FIRST
PURCHASE OF THAT ETF. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM'S SYSTEM DID NOT
TRIGGER PROSPECTUS DELIVERY FOR SUBSEQUENT ETF PURCHASES
WHERE INTERVENING UPDATES TO PROSPECTUSES REQUIRED SUCH
DELIVERIES.

THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH,
MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE SUPERVISORY CONTROL POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES THAT ADEQUATELY TESTED AND VERIFIED THAT IT
DESIGNED SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES CONCERNING ETF PROSPECTUS
DELIVERY TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS
AND REGULATIONS. THE FIRM TESTED ITS PROSPECTUS-DELIVERY
SYSTEM BY EMAILING ITS THIRD-PARTY VENDOR, TYPICALLY ON A
MONTHLY BASIS, SEEKING CONFIRMATION FOR THE MAILING OF
PROSPECTUSES FOR A SMALL SAMPLE OF TRADES THAT OCCURRED THE
PRIOR BUSINESS DAY. HOWEVER, THESE EMAILS FAILED TO ACHIEVE
THEIR PURPOSE BECAUSE THE VENDOR MISINTERPRETED THE FIRM'S
EMAILS AS INSTRUCTING IT ONLY TO PROSPECTIVELY SEND
PROSPECTUSES FOR THE SAMPLED TRANSACTIONS AND CONFIRM
DELIVERY FOR THEM. WHILE THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINED A DAILY
PRODUCTION LOG OF THE NUMBER OF PROSPECTUSES FOR DELIVERY
AND IMAGES OF MAILING LABELS FOR PROSPECTUSES FOR DELIVERY, IT

DURING REVIEW PERIOD I, THE FIRM OVER-REPORTED OPTIONS
POSITIONS TO THE LARGE OPTIONS POSITION REPORT (LOPR) IN
APPROXIMATELY 14,166 INSTANCES, AND UNDER-REPORTED OPTIONS
POSITIONS TO THE LOPR IN APPROXIMATELY 6,354 INSTANCES WHEN IT
MISTAKENLY SUPPRESSED "DELETE" RECORDS FROM THE LOPR THAT
SHOULD HAVE REPORTED. BECAUSE ONE OR MORE OF THE FIRM'S
SOURCE DATA FEEDS HAD GENERATED AN UNUSUALLY HIGH VOLUME OF
"DELETE" RECORDS, THE FIRM ERRONEOUSLY CONCLUDED THAT
CERTAIN POSITIONS SHOULD NOT BE REPORTED AS "DELETE" RECORDS
BUT SHOULD INSTEAD HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED FROM THE LOPR.
DURING REVIEW PERIOD I, THE FIRM ALSO FAILED TO REPORT OPTIONS
POSITIONS TO THE LOPR IN APPROXIMATELY 110,220 INSTANCES AFTER
ITS LOPR LOGIC HAD FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE SYMBOLS OF CERTAIN
UNDERLYING SECURITIES THAT HAD BEEN RECLASSIFIED AS "UNITS"
FOLLOWING A CORPORATE ACTION, SUCH AS A RE-ORGANIZATION, AND
TO REPORT THE OPTIONS ON SUCH SECURITIES TO THE LOPR. DURING
REVIEW PERIOD II, THE FIRM FAILED TO: (I) REPORT THREE OPTIONS

THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION ("COMMISSION") HAS
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND
GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (COLLECTIVELY, "RESPONDENTS," "GOLDMAN,"
OR THE "FIRM") HAVE VIOLATED THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT (THE
"ACT" OR "CEA") AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS ("REGULATIONS").
THE COMMISSION FINDS THE FOLLOWING:
BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2007 AND CONTINUING THROUGH MARCH 2012
(THE "RELEVANT PERIOD"), GOLDMAN, BY AND THROUGH CERTAIN OF ITS
TRADERS IN NEW YORK, ATTEMPTED TO MANIPULATE THE U.S. DOLLAR
INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION FIX ("USO
ISDAFIX" OR THE "BENCHMARK") TO BENEFIT GOLDMAN'S DERIVATIVES
POSITIONS IN INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS SWAPS, CASH-SETTLED OPTIONS
ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS, SWAP FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND AT TIMES
CERTAIN EXOTIC STRUCTURED PRODUCTS. ISDAFIX RATES AND
SPREADS ARE PUBLISHED DAILY AND ARE MEANT TO INDICATE THE
PREVAILING MID-MARKET RATE, AT A SPECIFIC TIME OF DAY, FOR THE
FIXED LEG OF A STANDARD FIXED-FOR-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP.
DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, USO ISDAFIX WAS SET EACH DAY IN A
PROCESS THAT BEGAN AT EXACTLY 11 :00 A.M. EST WITH THE CAPTURE
AND RECORDING OF SWAP RATES AND SPREADS FROM A U.S.-BASED
UNIT OF A LEADING INTEREST RATE SWAPS BROKING FIRM ("SWAPS
BROKER"). SWAPS BROKER DISSEMINATED RATES AND SPREADS
CAPTURED IN THIS 11:00 A.M. "SNAPSHOT," "FIX," OR "PRINT" AS
REFERENCES TO A PANEL OF BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS (COLLECTIVELY, "BANKS'").
ON CERTAIN DAYS ON WHICH GOLDMAN HAD A TRADING POSITION
SETTLING OR RESETTING AGAINST THE USO ISDAFIX, GOLDMAN
ATTEMPTED TO MANIPULATE USO ISDAFIX RATES THROUGH ITS TRADING
AT THE 11:00 A.M. FIXING AND BY MAKING SUBMISSIONS TO SWAPS
BROKER THAT WERE SKEWED TO BENEFIT DERIVATIVES POSITIONS HELD
BY GOLDMAN. GOLDMAN'S UNLAWFUL CONDUCT INVOLVED MULTIPLE
TRADERS, INCLUDING THE HEAD OF GOLDMAN'S INTEREST RATE
PRODUCTS TRADING GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES.

AT THE 11:00 A.M. FIXING AND BY MAKING SUBMISSIONS TO SWAPS
BROKER THAT WERE SKEWED TO BENEFIT DERIVATIVES POSITIONS HELD
BY GOLDMAN. GOLDMAN'S UNLAWFUL CONDUCT INVOLVED MULTIPLE
TRADERS, INCLUDING THE HEAD OF GOLDMAN'S INTEREST RATE
PRODUCTS TRADING GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES.
FIRST, CERTAIN GOLDMAN TRADERS BID, OFFERED, AND EXECUTED
TRANSACTIONS IN TARGETED INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING
SWAP SPREADS, AT THE CRITICAL 11:00 A.M. FIXING TIME WITH THE
INTENT TO AFFECT THE REFERENCE RATES AND SPREADS CAPTURED BY
SWAPS BROKER IN THE "PRINT" SENT TO SUBMITTING BANKS, AND
THEREBY TO AFFECT THE PUBLISHED USO LSDAFIX. AS CAPTURED IN
EMAILS AND AUDIO RECORDINGS, ON SOME OCCASIONS WHEN GOLDMAN
HAD DERIVATIVES POSITIONS SETTLING OR PRICING AGAINST USO
ISDAFIX, ITS TRADERS DISCUSSED AMONG THEMSELVES AND WITH
SWAPS BROKER EMPLOYEES THEIR INTENT TO MOVE USO LSDAFIX
RATES IN WHICHEVER DIRECTION BENEFITTED THEIR POSITIONS.
CERTAIN GOLDMAN TRADERS DESCRIBED SUCH ATTEMPTS TO
MANIPULATE USO ISDAFIX AS HAVING "GAMED THE FIX."
SECOND, CERTAIN TRADERS AT GOLDMAN ATTEMPTED TO MANIPULATE
USO ISDAFIX BY MAKING FALSE SUBMISSIONS TO SWAPS BROKER ON
BEHALF OF GOLDMAN, SKEWING THE RATES AND SPREADS SUBMITTED IN
THE DIRECTION THAT COULD HAVE MOVED THE USO ISDAFIX SETTING TO
BENEFIT GOLDMAN'S TRADING POSITIONS. A BANK'S DERIVATIVES
TRADING POSITIONS OR PROFITABILITY ARE NOT LEGITIMATE OR
PERMISSIBLE FACTORS ON WHICH TO BASE SUBMISSIONS IN
CONNECTION WITH A BENCHMARK.
YET ON MANY OCCASIONS IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD, GOLDMAN
TRADERS MADE USO ISDAFIX SUBMISSIONS HIGHER OR LOWER FOR THE
PURPOSE OF BENEFITTING DERIVATIVE POSITIONS PRICED OR VALUED
AGAINST THE BENCHMARK. THESE SUBMISSIONS WERE FALSE,
MISLEADING, OR KNOWINGLY INACCURATE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT
REPORT WHERE GOLDMAN WOULD ITSELF BID OR OFFER INTEREST RATE
SWAPS TO A DEALER OR GOOD CREDIT ABSENT A DESIRE TO MANIPULATE
USO ISDAFIX, BUT RATHER REFLECTED PRICES THAT WERE MORE
FAVORABLE TO THE FIRM'S SPECIFIC POSITIONS. AT TIMES, GOLDMAN
COMBINED SUCH WRONGFUL SUBMISSIONS WITH ITS ILLEGITIMATE
ATTEMPTS TO MANIPULATE THE BENCHMARK THROUGH TRADING TO
INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE TARGETED USO ISDAFIX RATES
WOULD MOVE IN A BENEFICIAL DIRECTION.

SECTIONS 15(B) AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
(EXCHANGE ACT) AGAINST GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. THESE PROCEEDINGS
ARISE OUT OF PRACTICES ENGAGED IN BY GOLDMAN'S SECURITIES
LENDING DEMAND TEAM (THE DEMAND TEAM), BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2008
AND MID-2013, IN PROVIDING AND DOCUMENTING "LOCATES" TO ENABLE
ITS CUSTOMERS TO EXECUTE SHORT SALES. BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2008
AND MID-2013, TO COMPLY WITH REG SHO, GOLDMAN EMPLOYED A
SYSTEM WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CUSTOMER SHORT SALE
LOCATE REQUESTS WERE HANDLED BY AN AUTOMATED MODEL THAT
WOULD EITHER GRANT, IN WHOLE OR IN PART (OR FILL), DENY, OR ROUTE
(OR PEND) THE REQUESTS FOR FURTHER REVIEW TO THE DEMAND
TEAM, A GROUP OF TEN TO TWELVE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORKED ON
GOLDMAN'S SECURITIES LENDING DESK. THE AUTOMATED MODEL WOULD
REVIEW AND FILL LOCATE REQUESTS BASED ON CERTAIN AVAILABLE
INVENTORY REPORTED TO GOLDMAN BY CERTAIN LENDING BANKS AND
BROKERAGES THAT FED INTO GOLDMAN'S AUTOMATED MODEL AT THE
START OF EACH DAY AFTER BEING REDUCED BY GOLDMAN BASED ON
THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH VARIOUS LENDERS (THE START-OF-DAY
INVENTORY). AS THE AUTOMATED MODEL PROCESSED LOCATE
REQUESTS, IT REDUCED THAT START-OF-DAY INVENTORY ON A 1:1 BASIS
FOR ALL SHARES THAT WERE USED TO GRANT LOCATE REQUESTS
(REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLIENT ACTUALLY USED THE LOCATE).
WHEN THE START-OF-DAY INVENTORY WAS DEPLETED IN THAT MANNER,
THE AUTOMATED MODEL WOULD PEND SUBSEQUENT LOCATE REQUESTS
TO THE DEMAND TEAM FOR FURTHER REVIEW AND PROCESSING. OVER
THE COURSE OF THE RELEVANT PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF LOCATE
REQUESTS THAT PENDED TO THE DEMAND TEAM GREW SIGNIFICANTLY,
REACHING MORE THAN 20,000 LOCATE REQUESTS PER DAY AT ITS PEAK.
THE VOLUME OF LOCATE REQUESTS BECAME FAR MORE THAN THE
DEMAND TEAM COULD MANUALLY HANDLE ON A REQUEST-BY-REQUEST
BASIS. THUS, INSTEAD OF MANUALLY IDENTIFYING AN ALTERNATIVE
SOURCE OF SECURITIES TO SATISFY THESE PENDED REQUESTS, THE
DEMAND TEAM PROCESSED APPROXIMATELY 98 PERCENT OF THE
PENDED REQUESTS BY RELYING ON A FUNCTION OF GOLDMAN'S ORDER
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REFERRED TO AS "FILL FROM AUTOLOCATE,"
WHICH WAS ACTIVATED BY THE "F3" KEY. THIS FUNCTION ENABLED THE
DEMAND TEAM TO CAUSE GOLDMAN'S AUTOMATED MODEL TO FILL
LOCATE REQUESTS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF INVENTORY THAT
EXISTED AT THE START OF THE DAY (I.E., THE START-OF-DAY INVENTORY
LEVEL BEFORE ANY LOCATES WERE GRANTED), EVEN THOUGH
GOLDMAN'S AUTOMATED MODEL HAD ALREADY TREATED THE START-OFDAY INVENTORY AS DEPLETED. IN PROCESSING LOCATE REQUESTS
USING THE "F3" FUNCTION, THE DEMAND TEAM TYPICALLY DID NOT
CHECK ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SECURITIES OR PERFORM A
MEANINGFUL FURTHER REVIEW. INSTEAD, THEY RELIED ON THEIR
GENERAL BELIEF THAT GOLDMAN'S AUTOMATED MODEL WAS
CONSERVATIVE AND THAT THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL LOCATES

DAY INVENTORY AS DEPLETED. IN PROCESSING LOCATE REQUESTS
USING THE "F3" FUNCTION, THE DEMAND TEAM TYPICALLY DID NOT

GENERAL BELIEF THAT GOLDMAN'S AUTOMATED MODEL WAS
CONSERVATIVE AND THAT THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL LOCATES
WOULD NOT RESULT IN FAILURES TO DELIVER THE SECURITIES IF AND
WHEN DUE FOR SETTLEMENT. THE DEMAND TEAM DID NOT DOCUMENT
THE BASIS FOR THIS GENERAL BELIEF. ADDITIONALLY, GOLDMAN'S
DOCUMENTATION OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH REG SHO IN ITS LOCATE LOG
WAS INACCURATE IN THAT GOLDMAN FAILED TO SUFFICIENTLY
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN LOCATES THAT WERE FILLED BY ITS
AUTOMATED MODEL AND LOCATES THAT WERE FILLED BY THE DEMAND
TEAM USING THE "F3" FUNCTION. IN BOTH CASES, THE LOCATE LOG
SIMPLY CONTAINED THE TERM "AUTOLOCATE" TO REFER TO THE STARTOF-DAY INVENTORY UTILIZED BY GOLDMAN'S AUTOMATED MODEL AS THE
SOURCE OF SECURITIES SUPPORTING THE LOCATE. AS A RESULT OF THE
CONDUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE, GOLDMAN WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION
17(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULES 203(B)(1)AND 203(B)(1)(III) OF

GOLDMAN HAS SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT WHICH THE

OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND ANY OTHER PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY
OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION, OR TO WHICH THE COMMISSION IS

SECTIONS 15(B) AND 21C OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER. IN
VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, THE COMMISSION DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE,
AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO IMPOSE THE SANCTIONS AGREED TO IN
GOLDMAN'S OFFER. ACCORDINGLY, PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 15(B) AND
21C OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: GOLDMAN IS
CENSURED AND MUST CEASE AND DESIST FROM COMMITTING OR
CAUSING ANY VIOLATIONS AND ANY FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF RULE
203(B)(1) OF REGULATION SHO PROMULGATED UNDER THE EXCHANGE
ACT, AND ANY VIOLATIONS AND ANY FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF SECTION
17(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 203(B)(1)(III) THEREUNDER

DAYS OF THE ENTRY OF THIS ORDER, PAY A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY IN THE
AMOUNT OF $15,000,000 TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION FOR TRANSFER TO THE GENERAL FUND OF THE UNITED
STATES TREASURY.
Regulator Statement

IN DETERMINING TO ACCEPT THE OFFER, THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED
REMEDIAL ACTS UNDERTAKEN BY GOLDMAN. BY AT LEAST MID-2013,
GOLDMAN HAD PHASED OUT THE USE OF ITS LEGACY AUTOMATED
MODEL AND IMPLEMENTED A NEW AUTOMATED MODEL WITH LOGIC THAT
SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF LOCATE REQUESTS PENDED
FOR DEMAND TEAM REVIEW. ADDITIONALLY, GOLDMAN IMPLEMENTED
REVISED WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING THE
PROCESSING OF LOCATE REQUESTS PENDED TO THE DEMAND TEAM.
SHORTLY AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMMISSION'S EXAMINATION
GOLDMAN ALSO DISCONTINUED THE USE OF THE AUTOLOCATE
FUNCTIONALITY. DEMAND TEAM MEMBERS ARE NOW REQUIRED TO
LOCATE A SPECIFIC SOURCE OF INVENTORY FOR EACH LOCATE REQUEST
AND TO IDENTIFY THAT SOURCE IN THE LOCATE LOG.

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE "COMMISSION") DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE
AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASEAND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED AGAINST
GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. ("GSCO" OR "RESPONDENT"). ON THE BASIS OF
THIS ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S OFFER, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT
THIS PROCEEDING ARISES OUT OF GSCO'S VIOLATIONS OF THE MARKET
ACCESS RULE AND AN EVENT THAT DISRUPTED TRADING IN THE OPTIONS
MARKETS ON AUGUST 20, 2013. ON AUGUST 20, 2013, AS A RESULT OF A
CONFIGURATION ERROR IN ONE OF GSCO'S OPTIONS ORDER ROUTERS,
THE FIRM ERRONEOUSLY SENT THOUSANDS OF $1.00 LIMIT ORDERS TO
THE OPTIONS EXCHANGES PRIOR TO THE START OF REGULAR MARKET
TRADING. BEFORE THE MARKET OPEN AT 9:30 A.M., GSCO SHUT OFF THE
CREATION OF ADDITIONAL OPTIONS ORDERS AND INITIATED EFFORTS TO
CANCEL THE ERRONEOUS ORDERS THAT IT HAD SENT TO THE
EXCHANGES. HOWEVER, WITHIN MINUTES AFTER THE OPENING OF
REGULAR MARKET TRADING, GSCO ALREADY HAD RECEIVED
EXECUTIONS FOR A PORTION OF ITS UNINTENDED SELL ORDERS,
REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION OPTIONS CONTRACTS
(REPRESENTING 150 MILLION UNDERLYING SHARES). THOUGH GSCO
FACED UP TO A POTENTIAL $500 MILLION LOSS FROM THE EXECUTIONS,
THE FIRM'S LOSS ULTIMATELY AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $38
MILLION, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EXECUTED ORDERS THAT WERE
CANCELLED OR RECEIVED PRICE ADJUSTMENTS PURSUANT TO THE
OPTIONS EXCHANGES' RULES CONCERNING CLEARLY ERRONEOUS
TRADES. THE AUGUST 20, 2013 OPTIONS TRADING EVENT RESULTED
FROM A SERIES OF FAILURES IN GSCO'S THEN-EXISTING SYSTEM OF RISK
MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES,
EXACERBATED BY HUMAN ERROR. FIRST, THE PRICE CHECKS IN GSCO'S
SIGMA OPTIONS ORDER MATCHING SYSTEM FAILED TO PREVENT THE
ENTRY OF THE ERRONEOUSLY PRICED PRE-MARKET ORDERS. IN
ADDITION, THE FIRM'S OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS
ELECTRONIC "CIRCUIT BREAKERS" DID NOT EFFECTIVELY BLOCK THE
ERRONEOUS ORDERS SENT ON AUGUST 20. BEFORE LIFTING THE
CIRCUIT BREAKER BLOCKS, THE CONTROL PERSONNEL DID NOT OBTAIN
AUTHORIZATION FROM THE RESPONSIBLE TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYEES, AS
REQUIRED UNDER WRITTEN FIRM POLICIES. THE FIRM'S POLICIES
RELATING TO THE MANUAL "LIFTING" OF THOSE CIRCUIT BREAKERS
WERE NOT DISSEMINATED TO OR FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE
EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING WHEN THE CIRCUIT BREAKERS
SHOULD BE LIFTED, AND, PRIOR TO AUGUST 20, 2013, GSCO PERSONNEL
HAD LIFTED CIRCUIT BREAKER BLOCKS SHORTLY AFTER LEARNING OF
THE BLOCK AND WHILE STILL INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE CIRCUIT
BREAKER TRIP. THE MANNER IN WHICH GSCO IMPLEMENTED SOFTWARE
CHANGES THAT IMPACTED THE FIRM'S ORDER FLOW ALSO CONTRIBUTED
TO THE AUGUST 20 EVENT. GSCO ALSO HAD DEFICIENCIES IN THE RISK
MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES DESIGNED

TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT THE FIRM

IN A PLANNED INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO). THE FINDINGS STATED
THAT A COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS ("SPONSORS")
INVITED THE FIRM TO COMPETE FOR A ROLE IN THE COMPANY'S PLANNED
IPO. THE FIRM ALLOWED ITS RESEARCH ANALYST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
FIRM'S SOLICITATION EFFORTS BY ALLOWING THE ANALYST TO PRESENT
HIS VIEWS ON THE COMPANY TO THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND
SPONSORS DURING THE SOLICITATION PERIOD. TO WIN THIS
INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS FROM THE COMPANY THE FIRM
ALLOWED ITS EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FIRM'S
SOLICITATION EFFORTS. THEREFORE, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
COMPANY'S IPO, THIS WAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BY THE RESEARCH
ANALYST AS THEY WERE PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN EFFORTS
TO SOLICIT INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM
COMPLIED WITH THE COMPANY'S REQUEST FOR A VALUATION THAT
INCLUDED THE ANALYST'S VIEWS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE
FIRM OFFERED FAVORABLE RESEARCH TO INDUCE THE COMPANY TO
AWARD THE FIRM ITS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS. THE FIRM'S
ANALYST'S PRESENTATION TO THE COMPANY AND THE SPONSORS
SUPPORTED THE FIRM'S INVESTMENT BANKING PITCH AND OFFERED A
POSITIVE EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THE COMPANY IPO, THE FIRM OFFERED FAVORABLE RESEARCH
COVERAGE TO INDUCE RECEIPT OF INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.
THE FIRM RESEARCH ANALYST EXPRESSED FAVORABLE VIEWS ABOUT

WOULD BE POSITIVE AND ALIGNED WITH INVESTMENT BANKING. SHORTLY
THEREAFTER, THE COMPANY AND THE SPONSORS SELECTED THE FIRM

TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT SUBMITTED
TO FINRA AND THE SEC BLUE SHEETS THAT INACCURATELY REPORTED
CERTAIN SHORT SALE TRANSACTIONS AS LONG SALE TRANSACTIONS

THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM REPORTED SHORT SALES AS LONG
SALES ON ITS BLUE SHEETS SUBMISSIONS WHEN THE TRADING DESK
USED A PARTICULAR MIDDLE OFFICE SYSTEM, THE DESK'S
TRANSACTIONS WERE PROCESSED THROUGH A CONTROL ACCOUNT, AND
DETAILS ABOUT SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS WERE TRANSMITTED TO THE
BLUE SHEET REPORTING PLATFORM VIA THE END OF DAY BATCH
PROCESS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO
INCLUDE CERTAIN STREET-SIDE TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED FOR
CUSTOMERS IN ITS BLUE SHEETS SUBMISSIONS TO FINRA CAUSING THEM
TO BE INACCURATE. THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO SUBMIT ACCURATE BLUE
SHEETS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS INTO
POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES LAWS. THE FINDINGS ALSO
INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE IN PLACE AN ADEQUATE AUDIT
SYSTEM PROVIDING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY OF ITS BLUE SHEET
SUBMISSIONS.

ASSOCIATION'S MISSION WAS TO KEEP ITS MEMBERS INFORMED OF
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THE
MUNICIPAL SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND TO PROVIDE A FORUM THROUGH
WHICH THE MUNICIPAL SECURITIES INDUSTRY COULD REVIEW AND
RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS. THE ASSOCIATION BILLED ITS
MEMBERS ON THE PER-BOND BASIS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE
WAS ANY DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT BOND ISSUANCE AND
THE ASSOCIATION'S ACTIVITIES, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE
ASSOCIATION PROVIDED ANY SERVICES REQUIRED FOR THE
UNDERWRITING. THE FIRM PAID THE ASSOCIATION A TOTAL OF $168,321.69
FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE UNDERWRITING OF APPROXIMATELY 52
APPLICABLE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM OBTAINED REIMBURSEMENT FOR
THE VOLUNTARY PAYMENTS FROM THE PROCEEDS OF MUNICIPAL AND
STATE BOND OFFERINGS WHICH WAS UNFAIR. THE ASSESSMENTS DID
NOT HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO ANY ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED WITH
RESPECT TO EACH BOND OFFERING. THE FIRM WAS NOT REQUIRED BY
ANY STATUTE OR REGULATION TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION
YET TREATED ITS ASSESSMENTS AS AN EXPENSE OF EACH TRANSACTION
AND REQUESTED AND RECEIVED REIMBURSEMENT OF THE PAYMENTS
FROM THE PROCEEDS OF EACH BOND OFFERING. THE FIRM LISTED THE
UNDERWRITING ASSESSMENTS AS EXPENSES OF THE UNDERWRITING
BUT ITS REQUESTS FOR REIMBURSEMENT WERE NOT FAIR BECAUSE
THEY WERE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE TO ISSUERS.
THE FIRM'S PRACTICES RESULTED IN THE EXPENDITURE OF THE
PROCEEDS OF MUNICIPAL AND STATE BOND OFFERINGS TO AN
ORGANIZATION ENGAGED IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. IN RESPONSE TO A
REQUEST FROM THE TREASURER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THE
FIRM HAS RETURNED $52,324.19 TO MULTIPLE ISSUERS AS A REFUND
FOR THE UNDERWRITING ASSESSMENTS REIMBURSED FROM OFFERING
PROCEEDS. THE FIRM FAILED TO ADOPT, MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE
WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS) REASONABLY DESIGNED
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH MSRB RULE G-17. THE FIRM FAILED TO
ESTABLISH REASONABLE PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING AND
DISCLOSING EXPENSES FOR MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ASSOCIATIONS FOR
WHICH IT REQUESTED REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE PROCEEDS OF
MUNICIPAL AND STATE OFFERINGS, AND FOR ENSURING THAT THOSE
REQUESTS WERE FAIR AND ADEQUATE. THE FIRM ALSO FAILED TO ADOPT,
MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE ADEQUATE SYSTEMS AND WSPS REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO MONITOR HOW THE MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ASSOCIATIONS
TO WHICH IT BELONGED USED THE FUNDS THAT THE FIRM PROVIDED.
ADEQUATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WERE ESPECIALLY NECESSARY

BELIEVE THAT GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. ("GOLDMAN" OR "RESPONDENT")
VIOLATED COMMISSION REGULATION ("REGULATION") 166.3, 17 C.F.R. §

AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER RESPONDENT
ENGAGED IN THE VIOLATIONS AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ORDER
SHOULD BE ISSUED IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS.
THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS INCLUDING AT
LEAST NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2007 (THE "RELEVANT PERIOD"),
GOLDMAN FAILED TO ENSURE THAT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS RISK
MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE, AND SUPERVISION PROGRAMS
COMPORTED WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS TO SUPERVISE DILIGENTLY ITS

FABRICATED FUTURES TRADES INTO ITS FRONT OFFICE SYSTEMS, WHICH
AGGREGATED MANUALLY ENTERED AND ELECTRONICALLY EXECUTED
TRADES IN THE SAME PRODUCT. AS A RESULT, ON SEVEN TRADING DAYS
IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2007, THE TRADER CIRCUMVENTED
GOLDMAN'S RISK MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE, AND SUPERVISION
SYSTEMS, BY ENTERING FABRICATED E-MINI S&P 500 SELL TRADES INTO
ITS MANUAL TRADING SYSTEM, WHICH ARTIFICIALLY OFFSET AND
THEREBY CAMOUFLAGED E-MINI S&P 500 BUY TRADES THE TRADER HAD
EXECUTED IN THE MARKET. IN PARTICULAR, THE TRADER ESTABLISHED
AN $8.3 BILLION E-MINI S&P 500 POSITION IN A FIRM TRADING ACCOUNT
ON DECEMBER 13, 2007. GOLDMAN SUFFERED A LOSS OF OVER $118
MILLION IN UNWINDING THE TRADER'S POSITION.
SEPARATELY, AFTER THE TRADER WAS DISCHARGED, GOLDMAN ORALLY
NOTIFIED THE CME AND THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY
AUTHORITY ("FINRA"). GOLDMAN'S ENSUING REGULATORY FILINGS WITH
THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION ("NFA") AND FINRA STATED THAT
THE TRADER HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF "VIOLATING INVESTMENT-RELATED
STATUTES, REGULATIONS, RULES, OR INDUSTRY STANDARDS OF
CONDUCT" FOR "CONDUCT RELATED TO INAPPROPRIATELY LARGE
PROPRIETARY FUTURES POSITIONS IN A FIRM TRADING ACCOUNT."
THEREAFTER, IN RESPONSE TO FINRA'S FOLLOW-UP INQUIRIES,
GOLDMAN PROVIDED ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION ONLY TO
FINRA, I.E., THAT THE TRADER ATTEMPTED TO CONCEAL HIS TRADING VIA
FABRICATED TRADES. GOLDMAN NEVER PROVIDED THAT ADDITIONAL
IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO THE NFA OR THE COMMISSION UNTIL AFTER
THE CFTC'S DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT COMMENCED ITS
INVESTIGATION.
GOLDMAN, A REGISTERED FCM, VIOLATED REGULATION 166.3 BECAUSE IT
FAILED TO IMPLEMENT OR FOLLOW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND PREVENT THE ENTRY OF
FABRICATED FUTURES TRADES INTO ITS MANUAL TRADE ENTRY
SYSTEMS. GOLDMAN'S TRADERS' ACCESS AND USE OF A MANUAL TRADE
ENTRY SYSTEM FOR ELECTRONICALLY-TRADED CONTRACTS WAS

CHAPTER XXIV, RULES 24.1 AND 24.4(A) OF THE BZX EXCHANGE RULES.:
THE FIRM MAINTAINED MULTIPLE PROPRIETARY ORDER ENTRY SYSTEMS,
INCLUDING G2 AND STRIDE. THE G2 ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM WAS
DEFICIENT IN THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT ONLY ALLOWED OPTIONS
ORDERS TO BE CODED AS "FIRM" "BROKER-DEALER" OR "CUSTOMER",
WITHOUT INCLUDING FUNCTIONALITY THAT WOULD ENABLE THE
SELECTION OF ORDERS AS "MARKET MAKER", AND DEFAULTED TO THE
"CUSTOMER" ORIGIN CODE IF NO ORIGIN CODE CATEGORY HAD BEEN
EXPLICITLY SELECTED BY THE FIRM'S SALES TRADERS OR OTHERS
ENTERING AN ORDER. THE STRIDE ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM WAS
DEFICIENT IN THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT HAD BEEN PROGRAMMED
TO CODE ALL ORDERS AS "CUSTOMER", WITHOUT ANY FUNCTIONALITY
FOR THE FIRM'S SALES TRADERS OR OTHERS TO SELECT AN ORIGIN
CODE. INSUFFICIENT COORDINATION AND INADEQUATE COMMUNICATION
AMONG THE DIFFERENT GROUPS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE G2 AND STRIDE SYSTEMS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE, EQUITY
DERIVATIVE SALES, AND SALES TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS A LACK OF
AWARENESS OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OPTIONS ORDER ORIGIN CODE
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND AN INADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF
THE FIRM'S CLIENT BASE FOR ITS LISTED OPTIONS BUSINESS AMONG
THE SYSTEM DEVELOPERS, CONTRIBUTED TO THE CREATION OF THE
DEFICIENCIES IN THE ORDER ENTRY SYSTEMS PREVIOUSLY
REFERENCED. AS A RESULT OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S ORDER
ENTRY SYSTEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM MARKED NUMEROUS
OPTIONS ORDERS WITH IMPROPER ORIGIN CODES. IN THE CASE OF G2
AND STRIDE, THE IMPROPER MARKING OF THESE OPTIONS ORDERS
PREVENTED THE EXCHANGE FROM RECEIVING PROPER EXECUTION
FEES FROM THE FIRM, AS "CUSTOMER" ORDERS SENT TO THE EXCHANGE
ARE CHARGED A LOWER EXECUTION RATE THAN OTHER ORDERS.

ANALYSTS' "HIGH-CONVICTION" SHORT-TERM TRADING IDEAS AND OTHER
"MARKET COLOR" CONCERNING STOCKS THEY COVERED, AS WELL AS
TRADERS' VIEWS ON THE MARKET. BEGINNING IN 2007, THE FIRM BEGAN A
PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE ASYMMETRIC SERVICE INITIATIVE (ASI),
PURSUANT TO WHICH RESEARCH ANALYSTS CALLED A SELECT GROUP
OF PRIORITY CLIENTS TO SHARE INFORMATION AND TRADING IDEAS
FROM THE HUDDLES. THE HUDDLES AND ASI WERE AN EXTENSIVE
UNDERTAKING CREATED BY THE FIRM WITH THE GOALS OF IMPROVING
THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM'S TRADERS AND GENERATING
INCREASED COMMISSION REVENUES FROM ASI CLIENTS. AT THE SAME
TIME, FIRM ANALYSTS WERE TOLD THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR
TRADING IDEAS WOULD BE MONITORED BY BOTH RESEARCH AND
TRADING. ANALYSTS' CONTRIBUTIONS TO HUDDLES AND ASI, SUCH AS
INCREASED COMMISSIONS GENERATED FROM ASI CLIENTS, WERE
DISCUSSED IN ANALYSTS' WRITTEN PERFORMANCE REVIEWS AND IN
OTHER DOCUMENTS USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANALYST EVALUATIONS.
THE FIRM'S HUDDLE PROGRAM CREATED A SERIOUS AND SUBSTANTIAL
RISK THAT ANALYSTS WOULD SHARE MATERIAL, NONPUBLIC
INFORMATION CONCERNING THEIR PUBLISHED RESEARCH WITH ASI
CLIENTS AND FIRM TRADERS. MANY OF THESE CLIENTS AND TRADERS
WERE FREQUENT, HIGH-VOLUME TRADERS, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
MISUSE OF MATERIAL, NONPUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING THE
FIRM'S PUBLISHED RESEARCH IN CONNECTION WITH THE HUDDLES WAS
HIGH. HOWEVER, THE FIRM DID NOT ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN, AND ENFORCE
ADEQUATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO PREVENT SUCH MISUSE IN
LIGHT OF THE RISKS ARISING FROM THE HUDDLES AND ASI. IN ADDITION,
ITS SURVEILLANCE OF TRADING AHEAD OF RESEARCH CHANGES, BOTH
IN CONNECTION WITH HUDDLES AND OTHERWISE, WAS DEFICIENT. AS A
RESULT, THE FIRM WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 15(G) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.

Allegations:

FINRA RULES 2010, 5280, NASD RULES 2110, 3010: THE FIRM
IMPLEMENTED A FORMALIZED BUSINESS PROCESS KNOWN AS TRADING
HUDDLES IN 2006, WHICH WERE INTERNAL MEETINGS, ORGANIZED BY
INDUSTRY SECTOR, AMONG THE FIRM'S EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS
AND TRADERS WHO INTERFACED WITH CLIENTS (INCLUDING MARKETMAKING AND CLIENT FACILITATION TRADERS). ACCESS TO THE TRADING
HUDDLES WAS NOT RESTRICTED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS, HOWEVER, AND
MAY HAVE INCLUDED CLIENTS ON CERTAIN OCCASIONS. TO ENHANCE
THE USEFULNESS OF ITS TRADING HUDDLES THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED A
PROGRAM IN JANUARY 2007 KNOWN AS THE ASYMMETRIC SERVICE
INITIATIVE ("ASI"), THROUGH WHICH IT PROVIDED THE INFORMATION
SHARED IN A STRUCTURED FORMAT IN TRADING HUDDLES TO
APPROXIMATELY 180 HIGH PRIORITY CLIENTS SELECTED BY THE FIRM'S
INSTITUTIONAL SALES GROUP. THE FIRM DID NOT DISCLOSE TO ITS
OTHER CLIENTS THAT IT WAS PROVIDING THE ASI SERVICE TO ITS
PRIORITY CLIENTS, BUT ANALYSTS WERE ALSO PERMITTED TO DISCUSS
THE IDEAS FROM TRADING HUDDLES WITH NON-ASI CLIENTS. UNDER THE
FIRM'S PROCEDURES, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS WERE NOT
PREVENTED FROM SEEKING APPROVAL FOR RESEARCH RATING AND
CONVICTION LIST CHANGES PRIOR TO OR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE
DISCUSSION OF SUCH STOCK AT A TRADING HUDDLE. THE FIRM
SOMETIMES APPROVED CHANGES TO THE ANALYST'S PUBLISHED RATING
ON A PARTICULAR STOCK SHORTLY FOLLOWING A TRADING HUDDLE IN
WHICH SUCH STOCK WAS DISCUSSED. THE FORMALIZED TRADING
HUDDLE AND ASI PROCESS CREATED A SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT MATERIAL
NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING ANALYSTS' PUBLISHED
RESEARCH, INCLUDING PREVIEWS OF RATING CHANGES OR CHANGES TO
CONVICTION LIST STATUS, COULD BE DISCLOSED TO CERTAIN PRIORITY
CLIENTS. THESE PROGRAMS WERE INSTITUTIONALIZED BY THE FIRM
WITHOUT ESTABLISHING ADEQUATE POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND
CONTROLS. BOTH THE TRADING HUDDLES AND THE ASI PROGRAMS
WERE DISCONTINUED IN 2011. AFTER CREATING THE TRADING HUDDLES
AND ASI PROGRAMS, THE FIRM FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE
INCREASED RISKS RESULTING FROM THESE PROGRAMS. BETWEEN

IN THE TRADING HUDDLES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WAS A
POSSIBLE PREVIEW OF AN UPCOMING RESEARCH CHANGE BY AN EQUITY
RESEARCH ANALYST DURING A TRADING HUDDLE REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THERE WAS SUCH A PREVIEW. THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH
A RELIABLE SYSTEM TO MEMORIALIZE THE DISCUSSIONS DURING THE
TRADING HUDDLES. IN JANUARY 2008, THE FIRM MADE THE EQUITY
RESEARCH ANALYSTS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANIZING A
TRADING HUDDLE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING A RECORD OF THE
IDEAS DISCUSSED IN THE TRADING HUDDLE. HOWEVER, THE FIRM FAILED

WAS IN FACT CREATING SUCH A RECORD. THE FIRM FAILED TO MAINTAIN A

ENTERED A CONSENT ORDER (DOCKET NO. CO-10-7842-S) WITH RESPECT
TO GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., A BROKER-DEALER REGISTERED UNDER THE
CONNECTICUT UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT. THE SETTLEMENT FOLLOWED
A COORDINATED MULTI-STATE INVESTIGATION INTO THE FIRM'S

TO REASONABLY SUPERVISE ITS AGENTS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE
FIRM'S CLIENTS WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY APPRISED OF ARS, THE
MECHANICS OF THE AUCTION PROCESS AND THE POTENTIAL ILLIQUIDITY
OF ARS; AND 2) THE FIRM ENGAGED IN UNETHICAL PRACTICES WITHIN

Allegations:

FINRA RULE 2010, NASD RULE 3010: IN TWO INSTANCES, THE FIRM FAILED
TO UPDATE FORMS U4 TO DISCLOSE INVESTIGATIONS WHEN IT WAS
REQUIRED TO DO SO BY FINRA BY-LAWS, ARTICLE V, SECTION 2(C). IN THE
FIRST INSTANCE, THE FIRM FAILED TO FILED AN AMENDMENT TO FORM U4
TO DISCLOSE THAT AN EMPLOYEE HAD RECEIVED A "WELLS NOTICE"
FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) IN
CONNECTION WITH THE AGENCY'S INVESTIGATION OF AN OFFERING OF A
SYNTHETIC COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION (CDO). THE RECEIPT OF A
WELLS NOTICE CLEARLY TRIGGERS A REPORTING OBLIGATION ON A
PERSON'S FORM U4. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE REPORTING
OBLIGATION CLEARLY EXISTED, THE FIRM FAILED TO ENSURE THAT THE
EMPLOYEE'S FORM U4 WAS AMENDED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF ITS
KNOWLEDGE OF THE WELLS NOTICE, AS REQUIRED UNDER THE BY-LAWS.
IN FACT, THE FORM U4 WAS NOT AMENDED UNTIL MORE THAN SEVEN
MONTHS AFTER THE FIRM LEARNED OF THE WELLS NOTICE, AND ONLY
AFTER THE SEC FILED ITS COMPLAINT AGAINST THE FIRM AND THE
EMPLOYEE. IN THE SECOND INSTANCE, THE FIRM FAILED TO AMEND
ANOTHER EMPLOYEE'S FORM U4 TO DISCLOSE THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A
WELLS NOTICE. THE WELLS NOTICE INDICATED THAT THE STAFF OF A
REGULATORY AGENCY HAD MADE A PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION TO
RECOMMEND THAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION BE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM. IN
THIS INSTANCE, THE FIRM'S LEGAL DEPARTMENT WAS PROMPTLY
INFORMED THAT A WELLS NOTICE HAD BEEN RECEIVED; HOWEVER, THE
FIRM DID NOT ENSURE THAT THE FORM U4 WAS AMENDED WITHIN 30
DAYS OF ITS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WELLS NOTICE, AS REQUIRED UNDER
THE BY-LAWS. THESE FAILURES OCCURRED BECAUSE THE FIRM DID NOT
HAVE ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND SYSTEMS IN PLACE
TO ENSURE THAT THE GLOBAL COMPLIANCE EMPLOYEE SERVICES
(GCES) GROUP WITHIN ITS GLOBAL COMPLIANCE DIVISION RECEIVED
PROMPT NOTICE THAT A REGISTERED PERSON WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN
"INVESTIGATION," AS THAT TERM IS USED IN FORM U4, SO THAT THE UNIT
COULD ENSURE THAT THE FORMS U4 WERE AMENDED ACCORDINGLY. IN

(GCES) GROUP WITHIN ITS GLOBAL COMPLIANCE DIVISION RECEIVED
PROMPT NOTICE THAT A REGISTERED PERSON WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN
"INVESTIGATION," AS THAT TERM IS USED IN FORM U4, SO THAT THE UNIT
COULD ENSURE THAT THE FORMS U4 WERE AMENDED ACCORDINGLY. IN
THE TWO INSTANCES HERE, THE GCES GROUP WAS NOT TIMELY
INFORMED OF THE WELLS NOTICE. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE IN PLACE AN
EFFECTIVE PROCEDURE TO ENSURE THAT THE GCES GROUP WAS
PROMPTLY NOTIFIED ABOUT WELLS NOTICES AFFECTING REGISTERED
PERSONS. INSTEAD, THE FIRM RELIED ON INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE
INFORMED OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A FORM U4 REPORTABLE EVENT TO
RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO TELL THE GCES GROUP AND TO TAKE THE
INITIATIVE TO DO SO. THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES,
DIVISIONAL SUPERVISORY MANUALS AND POLICIES IN EFFECT WERE
ALSO INADEQUATE. NOWHERE DO THEY MENTION "WELLS NOTICES"
SPECIFICALLY. MOREOVER, IN SEVERAL PLACES THE PROCEDURES
STATE THAT DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS FOUND
TO HAVE VIOLATED ANY PROVISION OF A SECURITIES LAW OR
REGULATION, OR IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR RESPONDENT IN A
REGULATORY PROCEEDING OR CIVIL LITIGATION, BUT ARE SILENT
REGARDING BEING THE SUBJECT OF A REGULATORY INVESTIGATION,
WHICH COULD RESULT IN A "YES" ANSWER TO ANY PART OF QUESTIONS
OF FORM U4. THIS CREATES THE MISTAKEN IMPRESSION THAT, WHEN A
REGISTERED PERSON IS INVESTIGATED BY THE SEC OR ANY SRO SUCH
AS FINRA, THE TRIGGERING EVENT REQUIRING A FORM U4 AMENDMENT
OCCURS, IF AT ALL, AT A STAGE SIGNIFICANTLY LATER THAN WHEN THE
REPRESENTATIVE RECEIVES A WELLS NOTICE. THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO
COMPLY WITH ITS FINRA BY-LAW ARTICLE V REPORTING OBLIGATIONS
IMPACTED FINRA'S AND OTHER SECURITIES REGULATORS' ABILITIES TO
DISCHARGE THEIR REGISTRATION, EXAMINATION, AND OVERSIGHT
DUTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTORS' AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS'
ABILITIES TO ASSESS THE INDIVIDUALS' BACKGROUNDS THROUGH

Allegations:

GOLDMAN SACHS CONVEYED TO CERTAIN CLIENTS THAT ARS WERE
SECURE, LIQUID SECURITIES THAT WERE A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR
CASH MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. IT DID SO THROUGH ITS SALES FORCE,
SOME OF WHOM REPRESENTED TO CERTAIN INVESTORS THAT AUCTION
RATE SECURITIES WERE HIGHLY LIQUID, SAFE INVESTMENTS FOR CASH
MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THESE REPRESENTATIONS WERE
MISLEADING AS TO CERTAIN INVESTORS. AUCTION RATE SECURITIES
WERE IN FACT DIFFERENT FROM CASH AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS. AS
DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE LIQUIDITY OF AN AUCTION RATE SECURITY
RELIED ON THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE DUTCH AUCTION
PROCESS. IN THE EVENT OF A FAILED AUCTION, INVESTORS CANNOT
SELL THEIR AUCTION RATE SECURITIES IN THAT AUCTION AND ARE
POTENTIALLY STUCK HOLDING LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, NOT MONEY
MARKET INSTRUMENTS. SINCE IT BEGAN PARTICIPATING IN THE AUCTION
RATE SECURITIES MARKET, GOLDMAN SACHS SUBMITTED "COVER" BIDS,
PURCHASE ORDERS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF AN AUCTION RATE SECURITY
ISSUE FOR WHICH IT ACTED AS THE SOLE OR LEAD AUCTION MANAGER.
SUCH "COVER" BIDS WERE GOLDMAN SACHS PROPRIETARY ORDERS
THAT WOULD BE FILLED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IF THERE WAS
OTHERWISE INSUFFICIENT DEMAND IN AN AUCTION. WHEN GOLDMAN
SACHS PURCHASED AUCTION RATE SECURITIES THROUGH "COVER" BIDS,
THOSE AUCTION RATE SECURITIES WERE THEN OWNED BY GOLDMAN
SACHS AND THE HOLDINGS WERE RECORDED ON GOLDMAN SACHS'
BALANCE SHEET. FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, GOLDMAN SACHS
IMPOSED LIMITS ON THE AMOUNTS OF SECURITIES ITS MUNICIPAL MONEY
MARKETS UNIT COULD HOLD (WHICH INCLUDED GOLDMAN SACHS'
AUCTION RATE SECURITIES HOLDINGS). BECAUSE MANY INVESTORS
COULD NOT ASCERTAIN HOW MUCH OF AN AUCTION WAS FILLED
THROUGH GOLDMAN SACHS "COVER" BIDS, THOSE INVESTORS COULD
NOT DETERMINE IF AUCTIONS WERE CLEARING BECAUSE OF NORMAL
MARKETPLACE DEMAND, OR BECAUSE GOLDMAN SACHS WAS MAKING UP
FOR THE LACK OF DEMAND THROUGH "COVER" BIDS. MANY INVESTORS
WERE ALSO NOT AWARE THAT THE LIQUIDITY OF THE AUCTION RATE
SECURITIES WAS DEPENDENT UPON
GOLDMAN SACHS' CONTINUED USE OF "COVER" BIDS. WHILE GOLDMAN
SACHS COULD TRACK ITS OWN INVENTORY AS A MEASURE OF THE
SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR ITS AUCTION RATE SECURITIES, MANY
INVESTORS HAD NO COMPARABLE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE OPERATION

WERE ALSO NOT AWARE THAT THE LIQUIDITY OF THE AUCTION RATE
SECURITIES WAS DEPENDENT UPON
GOLDMAN SACHS' CONTINUED USE OF "COVER" BIDS. WHILE GOLDMAN
SACHS COULD TRACK ITS OWN INVENTORY AS A MEASURE OF THE
SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR ITS AUCTION RATE SECURITIES, MANY
INVESTORS HAD NO COMPARABLE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE OPERATION
OF THE AUCTIONS. THERE WAS NO WAY FOR THOSE INVESTORS TO
MONITOR SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE MARKET OR TO ASSESS WHEN
BROKER-DEALERS MIGHT DECIDE TO STOP SUPPORTING THE MARKET,
WHICH COULD CAUSE ITS COLLAPSE. THE RESULTING MARKET
DISLOCATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVIDENT TO GOLDMAN SACHS. WHEN
CLIENT DEMAND FOR ITS AUCTION RATE SECURITIES DECLINED,
GOLDMAN SACHS' "COVER" BIDS FILLED THE INCREASING SHORTFALL,
THEREBY SUSTAINING THE IMPRESSION FOR CERTAIN INVESTORS THAT
AUCTIONS MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS WERE FUNCTIONING. AS A
RESULT, GOLDMAN SACHS' AUCTION RATE SECURITIES INVENTORY GREW
SIGNIFICANTLY, REQUIRING GOLDMAN SACHS TO RAISE ITS RISK
MANAGEMENT LIMITS FOR ITS MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKETS BUSINESS
(WHICH INCLUDED AUCTION RATE SECURITIES) SEVERAL TIMES. IN
FEBRUARY OF 200S, GOLDMAN SACHS AND OTHER FIRMS STOPPED
SUPPORTING AUCTIONS. WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF "COVER" BIDS, THE
AUCTION RATE SECURITIES MARKET COLLAPSED, LEAVING CERTAIN
INVESTORS WHO HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT THESE SECURITIES
WERE LIQUID, SAFE INVESTMENTS APPROPRIATE FOR MANAGING SHORTTERM CASH NEEDS, HOLDING LONG-TERM OR PERPETUAL SECURITIES
THAT COULD NOT BE SOLD AT PAR VALUE UNTIL AND IF THE
AUCTIONS CLEARED AGAIN.

Allegations:

NASD CONDUCT RULES 2110, 2440, IM-2440, 3010, 3110 AND 6240, AND
SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT, AND RULE 17A-3 AND
17A-4, THEREUNDER - RESPONDENT GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. CHARGED
MARKDOWNS RANGING FROM 9.4 PERCENT TO 30.4 PERCENT ON FIVE
PAIRS OF TRADES. IN EACH OF THESE PARIS, THE FIRM MARKUP TO ITS
CUSTOMER EXCEEDED THE LEVEL OF COMPENSATION PERMITTED BY
NASD RULE 2440 ADN IM-2440. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM FAILED TO CREATE
ADEQUATE RECORDS OF CUSTOMERS ORDERS RECEIVED BY
SALESPEOPLE WHO WORKED ON THE HIGH YIELD AND DISTRESSED
BOND DESKS. ACCORDING TO TRADERS AND SALESPEOPLE, MOST
TRADES ON THE HIGH YIELD AND DISTRESSED DESKS INVOLVED A
NEGOTIATED PROCESS WHEREBY A CUSTOMER INDICATED A POSSIBLE
INTEREST IN A TRADE AT A SPECIFIED PRICE OR WITHIN A SPECIFIED
PRICE RANGE. THEREAFTER, THERE COULD BE PRICE NEGOTIATIONS
THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT RESULT IN A TRADE. ALTHOUGH FIRM'S
CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY DID NOT PLACE AN ORDER BEFORE AGREEING
TO EXECUTE A TRADE, THE FIRM DID AT TIMES RECEIVE CUSTOMER
ORDERS BEFORE EXECUTING A TRADE AND FAILED IN SOME INSTANCES
TO COMPLETE APPROPRIATE ORDER DOCUMENTATION. THE FIRM ALSO
AT TIMES RECORDED INACCURATE TRADE EXECUTION TIMES IN ITS
RECORDKEEPING SYSTEM BECAUSE FIRM'S TRADE ENTRY SYSTEM
AUTOMATICALLY RECORDED THE TRADE ENTRY TIME AS THE TRADE
EXECUTION TIME, EVEN IF TRADE ENTRY WAS DELAYED. USE OF THIS
TRADE ENTRY SYSTEM ALSO RESULTED IN REPORTING OF SUCH
INACCURATE INFORMATION TO THE FIXED INCOME PRICING SYSTEM
("FIPS"). FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY SYSTEM FOR HIGH
YIELD AND DISTRESSED BOND TRADING WAS INADEQUATE IN SCOPE AND
FLAWED IN EXECUTION. ASSIGNMENTS WERE NOT CLEARLY MADE,

NEVINS IN THE SPX TRADING CROWD. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:45 A.M.,
GOLDMAN ENTERED A FOUR-WAY CUSTOMER NET DEBIT SPX SPREAD
ORDER ("ORIGINAL ORDER NO. 2") WITH GOLDMAN FLOOR BROKER
NEVINS. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:45 A.M., NEVINS CROSSED SOLICITED
ORDER NO. 2 WITH ORIGINAL ORDER NO. 2. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:45
A.M., GOLDMAN FAILED TO DISCLOSE TO MEMBERS OF THE SPX TRADING
CROWD ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AN ORIGINAL
CUSTOMER NET DEBIT SPREAD ORDER PRIOR TO CROSSING THE
CUSTOMER ORDER WITH A SOLICITED GOLDMAN PROPRIETARY NET
CREDIT SPREAD ORDER, WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF CAUSING THE SPX
CROWD MEMBERS TO BELIEVE THAT SOLICITED ORDER NO. 2 WAS IN
FACT THE ORIGINAL ORDER. AS A RESULT, GOLDMAN FAILED TO PROVIDE
MEMBERS OF THE SPX CROWD WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSERT THEIR
PRIORITY OVER THE SOLICITED ORDER. (CBOE RULES 4.1, 6.43, 6.24(A),

Allegations:

THE SEC'S ORDERS ALLEGE AS FOLLOWS: FROM 1990 THROUGH 1994,
EACH OF THE TEN BROKERAGE FIRMS CHARGED ISSUERS OF MUNICIPAL
REFUNDING BONDS EXCESSIVE, UNDISCLOSED MARKUPS ON TREASURY
SECURITIES. THE FIRMS ALSO CERTIFIED THAT THE PRICES THEY
CHARGED DID NOT EXCEED THE SECURITIES' FAIR MARKET VALUE
UNDER THE FEDERAL TAX LAWS, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW OR SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN THAT THEY WERE CHARGING PRICES ABOVE FAIR MARKET
VALUE. THE FALSE REPRESENTATIONS BY THE FIRMS ABOUT THE FAIR
MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES WERE CRITICAL TO ESTABLISHING
THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF THE ASSOCIATED MUNICIPAL REFUNDING
BONDS. THAT TAX-EXEMPT STATUS WAS THE BONDS' ESSENTIAL
INVESTMENT FEATURE. IN SOME CASES, A BROKERAGE FIRM'S
OVERCHARGING DIVERTED MONEY FROM THE U.S. TREASURY TO THE
FIRM. IN THE REMAINING CASES, OVERCHARGING BY THE BROKERAGE
FIRM TOOK MONEY AWAY FROM THE MUNICIPALITY BY REDUCING,
DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, THE SAVINGS THAT THE MUNICIPALITY RECEIVED
FROM THE REFUNDING. THEREFORE, EACH OF THE FIRMS VIOLATED THE
FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS BY SELLING SECURITIES TO MUNICIPALITIES
AT INFLATED PRICES AND JEOPARDIZING THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF
THE MUNICIPALITIES' REFUNDING BONDS.

Regulator Statement

+04/09/2000+ SEC NEWS DIGEST, ISSUE NO. 2000-65, DATED 04/06/2000,
ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS DISCLOSES: THE SEC TODAY BROUGHT
AND SETTLED CIVIL ADMINISTRATIVE FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST TEN
WALL STREET AND REGIONAL BROKERAGE FIRMS FOR OVERCHARGING
MUNICIPALITIES FOR GOVERNMENT SECURITIES IN A PRACTICE
COMMONLY KNOWN AS "YIELD BURNING." THE SETTLEMENTS
ANNOUNCED TODAY ARE PART OF A GLOBAL RESOLUTION OF ALL YIELD
BURNING CLAIMS WITH A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN BROKERAGE FIRMS BY
THE SEC, NASD REGULATION, INC., THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF THE
TREASURY. THIS GLOBAL RESOLUTION REQUIRES THE FIRMS TO PAY A
TOTAL OF MORE THAN $139 MILLION. INCLUDING THE ACTIONS
ANNOUNCED TODAY, MORE THAN $172 MILLION WILL HAVE BEEN PAID BY
21 FIRMS TO RESOLVE CHARGES OF YIELD BURNING AND RELATED
CLAIMS. YIELD BURNING INVOLVES OVERCHARGES BY BROKERAGE
FIRMS ON TREASURY SECURITIES PURCHASED WITH PROCEEDS FROM
THE SALE OF MUNICIPAL BONDS. YIELD BURNING BY BROKERAGE FIRMS
JEOPARDIZED THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF INTEREST PAID TO HOLDERS
OF THOSE BONDS. WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS,
EACH FIRM INCLUDING GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. CONSENTED TO A
CENSURE, A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER PROHIBITING FUTURE
VIOLATIONS, AND AGREED TO DISGORGE THE ILL-GOTTEN GAINS IT
RECEIVED FROM THE OVERCHARGING. (RELS. 33-7832; 34-42636; FILE NO.

SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 21489 / APRIL 16, 2010: THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION FILED SECURITIES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST
GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. ("GS&CO") AND A GS&CO EMPLOYEE, FOR
MAKING MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS IN CONNECTION
WITH A SYNTHETIC COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION ("CDO") GS&CO
STRUCTURED AND MARKETED TO INVESTORS. THIS SYNTHETIC CDO WAS
TIED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGEBACKED SECURITIES ("RMBS") AND WAS STRUCTURED AND MARKETED IN
EARLY 2007 WHEN THE UNITED STATES HOUSING MARKET AND THE
SECURITIES REFERENCING IT WERE BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF
DISTRESS. SYNTHETIC CDOS CONTRIBUTED TO THE RECENT FINANCIAL
CRISIS BY MAGNIFYING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOWNTURN IN
THE UNITED STATES HOUSING MARKET. ACCORDING TO THE
COMMISSION'S COMPLAINT, THE MARKETING MATERIALS, INCLUDING THE
TERM SHEET, FLIP BOOK AND OFFERING MEMORANDUM FOR THE CDO,
ALL REPRESENTED THAT THE REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF RMBS
UNDERLYING THE CDO WAS SELECTED BY A THIRD PARTY WITH
EXPERTISE IN ANALYZING CREDIT RISK IN RMBS. UNDISCLOSED IN THE
MARKETING MATERIALS AND UNBEKNOWNST TO INVESTORS, A LARGE
HEDGE FUND WITH ECONOMIC INTERESTS DIRECTLY ADVERSE TO
INVESTORS IN THE CDO, PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE PORTFOLIO
SELECTION PROCESS. AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE SELECTION OF THE
REFERENCE PORTFOLIO, THE HEDGE FUND EFFECTIVELY SHORTED THE
RMBS PORTFOLIO IT HELPED SELECT BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT
DEFAULT SWAPS ("CDS") WITH GS&CO TO BUY PROTECTION ON SPECIFIC
LAYERS OF THE CDO'S CAPITAL STRUCTURE. GIVEN ITS FINANCIAL SHORT
INTEREST, THE HEDGE FUND HAD AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO CHOOSE
RMBS THAT IT EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE CREDIT EVENTS IN THE NEAR
FUTURE. GS&CO DID NOT DISCLOSE THE HEDGE FUND'S ADVERSE
ECONOMIC INTEREST OR ITS ROLE IN THE PORTFOLIO SELECTION
PROCESS IN THE TERM SHEET, FLIP BOOK, OFFERING MEMORANDUM OR
OTHER MARKETING MATERIALS. THE DEAL CLOSED ON APRIL 26, 2007.
THE HEDGE FUND PAID GS&CO APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION FOR
STRUCTURING AND MARKETING THE CDO. BY OCTOBER 24, 2007, 83% OF
THE RMBS IN THE THE CDO PORTFOLIO HAD BEEN DOWNGRADED AND
17% WAS ON NEGATIVE WATCH. BY JANUARY 29, 2008, 99% OF THE
PORTFOLIO HAD ALLEGEDLY BEEN DOWNGRADED. INVESTORS IN THE

CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER, THE SEC TODAY FILED A COMPLAINT
AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF NASD AND
NYSE RULES. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT, FROM AT LEAST
JULY 1999 THROUGH JUNE 2001, RESEARCH ANALYSTS AT GOLDMAN
SACHS WERE SUBJECT TO INAPPROPRIATE INFLUENCE BY INVESTMENT
BANKING AT THE FIRM. THE COMPLAINT ALSO ALLEGES THAT GOLDMAN

"ALIGNED" ITS RESEARCH, EQUITIES, AND INVESTMENT BANKING
DIVISIONS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY IN ORDER TO FULLY LEVERAGE
ITS LIMITED RESEARCH RESOURCES. GOLDMAN SACHS ANALYSTS
PARTICIPATED IN INVESTMENT BANKING MARKETING EFFORTS,
INCLUDING WORKING WITH INVESTMENT BANKERS TO PREPARE "PITCH"
MATERIALS AND IN SOME CASES ATTENDING THE PITCH MEETINGS. IN
SEVERAL INSTANCES, THESE CONFLICTS RESULTED IN ANALYSTS
PUBLISHING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE EXAGGERATED OR
UNWARRANTED. GOLDMAN SACHS ALSO FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND
MAINTAIN ADEQUATE POLICIES, SYSTEMS, AND PROCEDURES
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE OBJECTIVITY OF ITS PUBLISHED
RESEARCH. THE SEC ALLEGES THAT DEFENDANT GOLDMAN SACHS
VIOLATED NASD CONDUCT RULES 2110, 2210(D)(1), 2210(D)(2) AND 3010,

SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 21457, MARCH 19, 2010: THE HONORABLE
JUDGE OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ISSUED AN ORDER ON MARCH 15, 2010
APPROVING MODIFICATIONS TO THE FINAL JUDGMENTS ENTERED
AGAINST THE DEFENDANT AND OTHERS. THE FINAL JUDGMENTS
CONTAINED AN EXTENSIVE ADDENDUM WITH PROVISIONS MANDATING
STRUCTURAL AND OTHER REFORMS THAT ADDRESSED POTENTIAL
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND
INVESTMENT BANKING. THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDED THAT WITH
RESPECT TO ANY PROVISION THAT HAD NOT BEEN EXPRESSLY
SUPERSEDED BY SUBSEQUENT RULEMAKING WITHIN FIVE YEARS, THE
SEC WOULD AGREE TO AN AMENDMENT/MODIFICATION OF SUCH TERM,
SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL, UNLESS THE SEC BELIEVES IT WOULD
NOT BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THE COURT APPROVED REMOVING A
NUMBER OF PROVISIONS. THE ADDENDUM NO LONGER INCLUDES
PROHIBITIONS AGAINST INVESTMENT BANKING INPUT INTO RESEARCH
ANALYST COMPENSATION AND THE BAR AGAINST RESEARCH ANALYSTS
PARTICIPATING IN EFFORTS TO SOLICIT INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS,
AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE MODIFIED ADDENDUM AS ORDERED BY THE
COURT AND SUPPORTED BY THE SEC MAINTAINED THE REQUIREMENT
THAT A CHAPERONE FROM LEGAL OR COMPLIANCE BE PRESENT WHEN
INVESTMENT BANKING SEEKS THE VIEWS OF RESEARCH ANALYSTS
CONCERNING A PROPOSED TRANSACTION OR A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE
FOR A TRANSACTION. ONE PROPOSED MODIFICATION WOULD HAVE
ALLOWED INVESTMENT BANKING TO SEEK THE VIEWS OF RESEARCH
ANALYSTS REGARDING MARKET OR INDUSTRY TRENDS, CONDITIONS, OR
DEVELOPMENTS WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENT OF A CHAPERONE,
SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS INCLUDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
CONTROLS AND TRAINING AS DESCRIBED IN THE NOVEMBER 30, 2009
LETTER TO THE COURT FROM THE SETTLING FIRMS. IN HIS MARCH 15,
2010 ORDER, THE HONORABLE JUDGE DID NOT APPROVE THIS
PROPOSED MODIFICATION. AS A RESULT OF THE COURT'S ORDER, THE
DEFENDANT REMAINS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT
RESTRICTIONS THAT APPLY ONLY TO IT AND OTHER FIRMS AFFECTED BY
THE FINAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENT. TOGETHER WITH THE REST
OF THE INDUSTRY, THEY ALSO REMAIN SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE
PROVISIONS OF NASD RULE 2711, NYSE RULE 472, AND THE SEC'S
