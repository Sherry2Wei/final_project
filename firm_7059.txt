What is included in a BrokerCheck report?
BrokerCheck reports for individual brokers include information such as employment history, professional
qualifications, disciplinary actions, criminal convictions, civil judgments and arbitration awards. BrokerCheck
reports for brokerage firms include information on a firm’s profile, history, and operations, as well as many of the
same disclosure events mentioned above.
Please note that the information contained in a BrokerCheck report may include pending actions or
allegations that may be contested, unresolved or unproven. In the end, these actions or allegations may be
resolved in favor of the broker or brokerage firm, or concluded through a negotiated settlement with no
admission or finding of wrongdoing.
Where did this information come from?
The information contained in BrokerCheck comes from FINRA’s Central Registration Depository, or
CRD® and is a combination of:
o information FINRA and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) require brokers and
brokerage firms to submit as part of the registration and licensing process, and
o information that regulators report regarding disciplinary actions or allegations against firms or brokers.
How current is this information?
Generally, active brokerage firms and brokers are required to update their professional and disciplinary
information in CRD within 30 days. Under most circumstances, information reported by brokerage firms, brokers
and regulators is available in BrokerCheck the next business day.
What if I want to check the background of an investment adviser firm or investment adviser
representative?
To check the background of an investment adviser firm or representative, you can search for the firm or
individual in BrokerCheck. If your search is successful, click on the link provided to view the available licensing
and registration information in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website at
https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. In the alternative, you may search the IAPD website directly or contact your
state securities regulator at http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/P455414.
Are there other resources I can use to check the background of investment professionals?
FINRA recommends that you learn as much as possible about an investment professional before
deciding to work with them. Your state securities regulator can help you research brokers and investment adviser
representatives doing business in your state.

Disclosure Event Details
What you should know about reported disclosure events:
1. BrokerCheck provides details for any disclosure event that was reported in CRD. It also includes
summary information regarding FINRA arbitration awards in cases where the brokerage firm was
named as a respondent.
2. Certain thresholds must be met before an event is reported to CRD, for example:
o A law enforcement agency must file formal charges before a brokerage firm is required to disclose a
particular criminal event.
3. Disclosure events in BrokerCheck reports come from different sources:
o Disclosure events for this brokerage firm were reported by the firm and/or regulators. When the firm
and a regulator report information for the same event, both versions of the event will appear in the
BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source
labeled.
4. There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:
o A disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, or final.
§ A "pending" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated.
§ An event that is "on appeal" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently
being appealed.
§ A "final" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.
o A final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled or otherwise resolved.
§ An "adjudicated" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter,
or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party
charged with some alleged wrongdoing.
§ A "settled" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter.
Please note that firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for
business or other reasons.
§ A "resolved" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of
wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker. Such matters generally involve customer
disputes.
5. You may wish to contact the brokerage firm to obtain further information regarding any of the
disclosure events contained in this BrokerCheck report.

Regulatory - Final
This type of disclosure event involves (1) a final, formal proceeding initiated by a regulatory authority (e.g., a state
securities agency, self-regulatory organization, federal regulator such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
foreign financial regulatory body) for a violation of investment-related rules or regulations; or (2) a revocation or
suspension of the authority of a brokerage firm or its control affiliate to act as an attorney, accountant or federal
contractor.

OF REGULATION NMS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

REASONS. FIRST, THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE A SYSTEM OF REVIEW FOR
INTERMARKET SWEEP ORDERS (ISOS) INDEPENDENT OF EXECUTIONS.
SECOND, LIMITATIONS IN THE FIRM'S ORDER ROUTING SYSTEM LED TO A

SEC ADMIN RELEASE 33-10545, 34-84124 / SEPTEMBER 14, 2018:
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("COMMISSION") DEEMS IT
APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED
AGAINST CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS, INC. ("CGMI") AND CITI ORDER
ROUTING AND EXECUTION, LLC (F/K/A AUTOMATED TRADING DESK
FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC) ("CORE") (TOGETHER, "RESPONDENTS").
THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THIS PROCEEDING ARISES FROM THE
CONDUCT OF RESPONDENTS IN CONNECTION WITH A "CROSSING
NETWORK" OR "DARK POOL" CALLED CITI MATCH. FROM AT LEAST
DECEMBER 2011 THROUGH JUNE 2014 (THE "RELEVANT PERIOD"), CGMI
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MARKETING AND SALES OF CITI MATCH AND
CORE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS DAY-TO-DAY OPERATION.
CGMI MARKETED CITI MATCH EXCLUSIVELY TO INSTITUTIONAL
CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUND AND RETIREMENT FUND
ADVISERS. DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, CGMI MADE MATERIAL

DECEMBER 2011 THROUGH JUNE 2014 (THE "RELEVANT PERIOD"), CGMI
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MARKETING AND SALES OF CITI MATCH AND
CORE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS DAY-TO-DAY OPERATION.
CGMI MARKETED CITI MATCH EXCLUSIVELY TO INSTITUTIONAL
CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUND AND RETIREMENT FUND
ADVISERS. DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, CGMI MADE MATERIAL
MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS TO THESE INSTITUTIONAL USERS
CONCERNING (A) THE TYPES OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WERE
ALLOWED TO PLACE ORDERS IN CITI MATCH AND (B) CITI MATCH'S
PRACTICE OF ROUTING ORDERS TO OTHER TRADING VENUES FOR
EXECUTION.
NOTWITHSTANDING CGMI'S STATEMENTS THAT HFT FIRMS WERE NOT
ALLOWED TO ENTER ORDERS IN CITI MATCH, TWO PROPRIETARY
TRADING FIRMS THAT CAN REASONABLY BE CONSIDERED HIGH
FREQUENCY TRADING FIRMS ("TRADING FIRM A" AND "TRADING FIRM B")
WERE AMONG CITI MATCH'S TOP USERS FOR CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE
RELEVANT PERIOD AND REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CITI
MATCH'S TOTAL TRADING ACTIVITY.
CGMI FAILED TO ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE TO ALL USERS THAT ORDERS
SENT TO CITI MATCH COULD BE ROUTED TO, AND EXECUTED IN, VARIOUS
EXTERNAL VENUES.
DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF ALL
EXECUTIONS THAT USERS OBTAINED FROM SENDING ORDERS TO CITI
MATCH TOOK PLACE ON EXTERNAL VENUES.
THE EXTERNAL VENUES TO WHICH CITI MATCH ROUTED ORDERS
INCLUDED A WIDE-RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS ("ATSS"),
EXCHANGES AND ELECTRONIC MARKET MAKERS. THESE EXTERNAL
VENUES TYPICALLY CHARGED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FOR TRADE
EXECUTIONS THAN CITI MATCH AND MANY DID NOT SHARE THE PREMIUM
CHARACTERISTICS THAT CGMI DESCRIBED CITI MATCH AS HAVING.
DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, ONE OF THE TOP EXTERNAL ROUTING
DESTINATIONS FOR CITI MATCH ORDERS WAS A DIFFERENT, LOWER COST
ATS OPERATED BY CGMI CALLED CITI CROSS. CITI CROSS WAS DESIGNED
AND MARKETED AS A DARK POOL THAT WOULD ACCEPT HFT ORDERS,
AND CHARGED ONLY A FRACTION OF CITI MATCH'S COMMISSION RATE. IN
2013 AND 2014, CITI CROSS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN HALF OF ALL
EXTERNALLY-ROUTED TRADES FROM CITI MATCH.
WHEN CITI MATCH ORDERS WERE ROUTED OUT TO CITI CROSS OR
ANOTHER EXTERNAL VENUE, CGMI CHARGED ITS USERS THE CITI MATCH
COMMISSION RATE FOR ALL EXECUTIONS.
WHILE CGMI DISCLOSED EXTERNAL ROUTING TO SOME USERS IN
INDIVIDUALIZED COMMUNICATIONS, SUCH AS QUESTIONNAIRE
RESPONSES, NONE OF THE MARKETING MATERIALS, TECHNICAL
SPECIFICATIONS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT CGMI WIDELY
DISTRIBUTED TO CITI MATCH USERS DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD
MENTIONED EXTERNAL ROUTING, EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THESE
MATERIALS PURPORTED TO EXPLAIN CITI MATCH'S KEY FEATURES.
FURTHER, AS DETAILED BELOW, IN MANY INSTANCES THE ELECTRONIC
MESSAGES SENT TO CITI MATCH USERS IDENTIFIED CITI MATCH AS THE
EXECUTION VENUE FOR ALL "CITI MATCH" TRADES, EVEN IF THOSE
ORDERS HAD BEEN ROUTED TO AND EXECUTED ON AN EXTERNAL

TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT
DISADVANTAGED CERTAIN RETIREMENT PLAN AND CHARITABLE

A SHARES IN CERTAIN MUTUAL FUNDS WITHOUT A FRONT-END SALES
CHARGE. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THESE ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS
WERE INSTEAD SOLD CLASS A SHARES WITH A FRONT-END SALES
CHARGE, OR CLASS B OR C SHARES WITH BACK-END SALES CHARGES,
AND HIGHER ONGOING FEES AND EXPENSES. THESE SALES
DISADVANTAGED ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS BY CAUSING SUCH CUSTOMERS
TO PAY HIGHER FEES THAN THEY WERE ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO PAY.
THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO REASONABLY
SUPERVISE THE APPLICATION OF SALES CHARGE WAIVERS TO ELIGIBLE
MUTUAL FUND SALES. THE FIRM RELIED ON ITS FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO
DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF SALES-CHARGE WAIVERS, BUT FAILED
TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE WRITTEN POLICIES OR PROCEDURES TO ASSIST
FINANCIAL ADVISORS IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION.IN ADDITION, THE
FIRM FAILED TO ADEQUATELY NOTIFY AND TRAIN ITS FINANCIAL
ADVISORS REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF MUTUAL FUND SALES
CHARGE WAIVERS FOR ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS. THE FIRM ALSO FAILED TO
ADOPT ADEQUATE CONTROLS TO DETECT INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY DID
NOT PROVIDE SALES CHARGE WAIVERS TO ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS IN
CONNECTION WITH THEIR MUTUAL FUND PURCHASES. AS A RESULT OF
THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO APPLY AVAILABLE SALES-CHARGE WAIVERS, THE
FIRM ESTIMATES THAT ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS WERE OVERCHARGED BY
APPROXIMATELY $264,844 FOR MUTUAL FUND PURCHASES MADE SINCE
JANUARY 1, 2011.

Regulator Statement

AFTER FINRA INITIATED AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRM, THE FIRM BEGAN
A REVIEW TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT PROVIDED AVAILABLE SALES
CHARGE WAIVERS TO ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT
APPROXIMATELY 274 CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS PURCHASED MUTUAL FUND
SHARES FOR WHICH AN AVAILABLE SALES CHARGE WAIVER WAS NOT
APPLIED. AS A RESULT OF THE FAILURE OF THE FIRM TO APPLY AVAILABLE
SALES CHARGE WAIVERS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT ELIGIBLE
CUSTOMERS WERE OVERCHARGED BY APPROXIMATELY $264,844 FOR
MUTUAL FUND PURCHASES MADE SINCE JANUARY 1, 2011. AS PART OF
THIS SETTLEMENT, THE FIRM AGREES TO PAY RESTITUTION TO ELIGIBLE
CUSTOMERS ON THE TERMS SPECIFIED BELOW, WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO
TOTAL $309,093 (I.E., THE AMOUNT ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS WERE
OVERCHARGED, INCLUSIVE OF INTEREST). THE FIRM WILL ALSO ENSURE
THAT RETIREMENT AND CHARITABLE WAIVERS ARE APPROPRIATELY
APPLIED TO ALL FUTURE TRANSACTIONS.

PURSUANT TO SECTION 21C OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AGAINST CITIGROUP
INC. ("CITIGROUP" AND, TOGETHER WITH CGMI, "CITI" OR
"RESPONDENTS").
THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THIS MATTER INVOLVES CGMI'S FAILURE
REASONABLY TO SUPERVISE ITS TRADERS WITH A VIEW TOWARDS
PREVENTING MISMARKING AND UNAUTHORIZED TRADING IN CITI
PROPRIETARY ACCOUNTS THAT ULTIMATELY CAUSED CGMI'S BOOKS AND
RECORDS, AND THOSE OF ITS PARENT, CITIGROUP, TO BE INACCURATE.
DURING THE PERIOD FROM DECEMBER 2014 TO MARCH 2016, CGMI
DISCOVERED AND REPORTED TO THE COMMISSION STAFF THREE
SEPARATE INSTANCES INVOLVING MISMARKING BY THREE TRADERS,
EACH ON A DIFFERENT TRADING DESK. THE DISCOVERY OF EACH
MISMARKING RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OF PREVIOUSLY-UNREPORTED LOSSES OR THE REVERSAL OF
IMPROPERLY REPORTED UNREALIZED GAINS IN RESPONDENTS' BOOKS
AND RECORDS. THE THREE MISMARKING EPISODES OVERLAPPED IN
TIME, SPANNING THE PERIOD MID-2013 THROUGH EARLY 2016 (THE
"RELEVANT PERIOD"), WITH EACH PERSISTING FOR MULTIPLE QUARTERS.
ALL THREE MISMARKING SCENARIOS INVOLVED OPAQUE, ILLIQUID
POSITIONS THAT WERE OVERVALUED BY TRADERS AND NOT
EFFECTIVELY PRICE VERIFIED BY CITI'S VALUATION CONTROL GROUP.
TWO OF THE SCENARIOS ALSO INVOLVED UNAUTHORIZED TRADING IN
U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES ("USTS"), LEADING TO LOSSES THAT WERE
LARGELY CONCEALED BY THE MISMARKINGS; IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES,
THE UNAUTHORIZED TRADING AND MISMARKING PERSISTED FOR MORE
THAN A YEAR WITHOUT BEING DETECTED WITHIN CGMI'S SUPERVISORY
FRAMEWORK.
THE MISMARKING AND UNAUTHORIZED TRADING CAUSED CGMI'S BOOKS
AND RECORDS REQUIRED TO BE MADE AND KEPT PURSUANT TO SECTION
17(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 17A-3(A) THEREUNDER,
INCLUDING ITS "[L]EDGERS (OR OTHER RECORDS) REFLECTING ALL
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCOME AND EXPENSE AND CAPITAL
ACCOUNTS," TO BE INACCURATE DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. THE
MISMARKING BY ONE TRADER ALSO RENDERED CGMI'S FINANCIAL AND

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A REASONABLE SYSTEM TO REVIEW FOR THE
ACCURACY OF THE CONTENT IN THE FIRM'S CUSTOMER TRADE
CONFIRMATIONS. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM'S WRITTEN
SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS) WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED
TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS
AND REGULATIONS, AND WITH APPLICABLE NASD AND FINRA RULES,
CONCERNING THE ISSUANCE OF ACCURATE TRADE CONFIRMATIONS. THE
FIRM'S SUPERVISORY DEFICIENCIES, AND FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT AN
ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK AROUND ITS CUSTOMER TRADE
CONFIRMATION ACCURACY OBLIGATIONS, CAUSED THE FIRM TO FAIL TO
DETECT A NUMBER OF SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES THAT OCCURRED, WHICH
RESULTED IN THE FIRM ISSUING MILLIONS OF INACCURATE TRADE
CONFIRMATIONS TO ITS INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS. DUE TO
SUPERVISORY DEFICIENCIES THAT OCCURRED DURING THE MORE THAN
11-YEAR REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 12.5 MILLION
CUSTOMER TRADE CONFIRMATIONS TO ITS INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS
WITH INACCURATE INFORMATION, APPROXIMATELY 9.3 MILLION OF WHICH
CONTAINED ERRORS REGARDING THE FIRM'S CAPACITY IN EXECUTING
TRADES, AND APPROXIMATELY 3.2 MILLION OF WHICH INCORRECTLY
IDENTIFIED SINGLE EXECUTION TRADES AS AVERAGE PRICE TRADES.
GIVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH THE FIRM PROVIDED
INACCURATE INFORMATION TO ITS INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS, THE
FIRM'S SUPERVISORY MISCONDUCT POTENTIALLY PREVENTED THESE
CUSTOMERS FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCURATELY VERIFY THE CAPACITY

GIVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH THE FIRM PROVIDED
INACCURATE INFORMATION TO ITS INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS, THE
FIRM'S SUPERVISORY MISCONDUCT POTENTIALLY PREVENTED THESE
CUSTOMERS FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCURATELY VERIFY THE CAPACITY
IN WHICH THE FIRM ACTED, OR WHETHER THE FIRM EXECUTED A SINGLE
TRANSACTION OR AN AVERAGE-PRICED TRANSACTION, FOR MILLIONS OF
TRANSACTIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT WHILE THE FIRM HAD
VARIOUS WSPS IN PLACE PERTAINING TO CONFIRMATIONS AND
REFERENCING RULE 10B-10 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
(EXCHANGE ACT), THESE PROCEDURES FAILED TO DESCRIBE AN
ADEQUATE AND REASONABLE REVIEW TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF
THE CONTENT IN THE FIRM'S CUSTOMER TRADE CONFIRMATIONS.
INSTEAD, THE PROCEDURES DISCUSSED ONLY WHETHER THE FIRM
PHYSICALLY OR ELECTRONICALLY DELIVERED TRADE CONFIRMATIONS
TO CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED
ADDITIONAL RELEVANT REVIEWS DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, THESE
REVIEWS CONTINUED TO EVIDENCE A FAILURE TO CONDUCT ADEQUATE
AND REASONABLE SUPERVISORY PREVIEWS OF THE CONTENTS OF ITS
INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS' TRADE CONFIRMATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED A MONTHLY SAMPLING REVIEW FOR THE
ACCURACY OF TRADE CONFIRMATIONS IN SEPTEMBER 2015. HOWEVER,
THAT REVIEW WAS DEFICIENT IN THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH
AND MAINTAIN WSPS THAT SET FORTH A METHOD OF SUPERVISORY
OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THE REVIEW WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED.
MOREOVER, THE SYSTEMIC SUPERVISORY DEFICIENCIES THAT
RESULTED IN THE VIOLATIONS OF EXCHANGE ACT RULE 10B-10(A)(2)
WERE CORRECTED BETWEEN AUGUST 2015 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2017,
AND ONE OF THE SYSTEMIC SUPERVISORY DEFICIENCIES THAT
RESULTED IN THE VIOLATIONS OF EXCHANGE ACT RULE 10B-10(A)(1) WAS
CORRECTED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2017. ADDITIONALLY, IN MAY 2016, THE
FIRM COMPLETED A PORTION OF AN "END-TO-END" PROJECT TO TRACK
CAPACITY "VALUES" ON CUSTOMER TRADE CONFIRMATIONS. THE FIRM
COMPLETED THE "END-TO-END" PROJECT IN AUGUST OF 2017.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED

INCLUDE TWO ACCOUNTS ENGAGED IN PROPRIETARY TRANSACTIONS IN
ANY OF ITS INDEPENDENT TRADING AGGREGATION UNIT, AND DID NOT
INCLUDE THE SECURITIES POSITIONS IN THOSE ACCOUNTS IN ITS
AGGREGATE CALCULATIONS FOR ANY INDEPENDENT AGGREGATION UNIT.
THE FINDINGS STATED THAT SPECIFICALLY, THE FIRM STARTED TO USE
THE ACCOUNTS TO FACILITATE CERTAIN BROKER-DEALER CLIENT
ORDERS FLOW BY PLACING THEM IN A CONFIDENTIAL, WALLED OFF
"BLACK BOX" AND CREATING NEW "REPRESENTATIVE" ORDERS IN THE
ACCOUNTS. THE REPRESENTATIVE ORDERS HAD NEW ORDER
IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS AND THEIR ROUTING TO THE MARKETPLACE
WERE WITH THE TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND ORDER MARKING
INSTRUCTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL BROKER-DEALER CLIENT ORDERS. THE
FIRM FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WITH RESPECT TO THIS BROKERDEALER ORDER FLOW, THE ACCOUNTS WERE ENGAGING IN
PROPRIETARY TRANSACTIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN AN
AGGREGATION UNIT FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING ITS NET POSITION.
THE FAILURE TO INCLUDE THESE PROPRIETARY TRANSACTIONS IN THE
NET POSITION CALCULATIONS IN ANY AGGREGATION UNIT HAD AN
UNQUANTIFIED IMPACT ON THE FIRM'S OVERALL REGULATION SHO
OBLIGATIONS, POTENTIALLY INCLUDING ORDER MARKING, LOCATE, AND
TRADE REPORTING OBLIGATIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE

REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE
APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING SEC AND
FINRA RULES, TO ENSURE THAT ALL FIRM ACCOUNTS CONDUCTING
PROPRIETARY BUSINESS WERE APPROPRIATELY INCLUDED IN

FIVE YEARS IT DISPLAYED TO ITS BROKERS, CUSTOMERS, AND
SUPERVISORS INACCURATE RESEARCH RATINGS FOR OVER 1,800 EQUITY
SECURITIES, MORE THAN 38 PERCENT OF THOSE COVERED BY THE FIRM.
THE FINDINGS STATED THAT WHEN THE FIRM BEGAN USING A NEW
CLEARING FIRM IT CREATED AND PROVIDED AN ELECTRONIC FEED OF ITS
RESEARCH RATINGS DATA. A VARIETY OF ERRORS WITH THE ELECTRONIC
FEED RENDERED INACCURATE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF RESEARCH
RATINGS. BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN THE ELECTRONIC FEED OF RATINGS
DATA THAT THE FIRM PROVIDED TO ITS CLEARING FIRM, THE FIRM EITHER
DISPLAYED THE WRONG RESEARCH RATING (I.E., A "BUY" WHEN THE
ACTUAL RATING WAS A "SELL" OR "NEUTRAL;" A "SELL" WHEN THE RATING
WAS A "BUY" OR "NEUTRAL;" OR A "NEUTRAL" WHEN THE RATING WAS A

ACTUAL RESEARCH REPORTS, WHICH WERE AVAILABLE TO BROKERS,
AND THE RESEARCH RATINGS APPEARING IN THOSE REPORTS, AS
PUBLISHED BY THE FIRM'S RESEARCH DEPARTMENT, WERE NOT
AFFECTED BY THESE ERRORS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT
BECAUSE OF THE ERRORS WITH THE ELECTRONIC FEED, THE FIRM,
THROUGH ITS BROKERS, NEGLIGENTLY MADE INACCURATE STATEMENTS
TO CUSTOMERS CONCERNING FIRM RESEARCH RATINGS. WHEN MAKING
SECURITIES RECOMMENDATIONS, THE FIRM'S BROKERS RELIED ON
INACCURATE RATINGS THAT IT DISPLAYED ON ITS INTERNAL ONLINE
PORTAL. AS A RESULT, CUSTOMERS EXECUTED THOUSANDS OF
TRANSACTIONS THAT, ALTHOUGH CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERNALLY
DISPLAYED RATINGS, WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE ACTUAL FIRM
RESEARCH RATINGS. THE FIRM'S BROKERS ALSO RELIED ON THE
INACCURATE RESEARCH RATINGS TO CONSTRUCT CUSTOMERS'
PORTFOLIOS IN CERTAIN FIRM-MANAGED ACCOUNTS, THEREBY CAUSING
A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THESE ACCOUNTS TO VIOLATE PORTFOLIO
GUIDELINES BY HOLDING SELL-RATED STOCKS OR HOLDING MORE THAN
THE ALLOWABLE PERCENTAGE OF NON-RATED SECURITIES. THE FIRM
MADE MATERIALLY INACCURATE STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS
REGARDING FIRM RESEARCH RATINGS IN THREE TYPES OF CUSTOMER
COMMUNICATIONS: (1) CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS, (2) ONLINE
PORTALS, AND (3) E-MAILS THAT ALERTED SUBSCRIBED CLIENTS TO
CHANGES IN FIRM RESEARCH RATINGS FOR SELECTED SECURITIES.
OVER 19,000 INACCURATE RATINGS WERE DISPLAYED ON CUSTOMER
STATEMENTS. THE ERRORS ALSO AFFECTED CUSTOMERS WHO
SUBSCRIBED TO RECEIVE ALERTS FOR 353 AFFECTED SECURITIES,
TOTALING OVER 1,000 AFFECTED ALERTS. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED
THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SUPERVISORY
SYSTEM AND WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS)
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT IT DISSEMINATED ACCURATE
AND COMPLETE RESEARCH RATINGS TO CUSTOMERS, BROKERS, AND
SUPERVISORS. IN PARTICULAR, THE FIRM FAILED TO CONDUCT TESTING
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO VERIFY THAT ITS CLEARING FIRM OBTAINED
AND DISTRIBUTED ACCURATE AND COMPLETE FIRM RESEARCH RATINGS
INFORMATION. THE FIRM FAILED TO TIMELY ADDRESS RED FLAGS
REGARDING RESEARCH RATING ACCURACY ISSUES. THE FIRM HAD IN ITS
POSSESSION INFORMATION CONCERNING POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT
PROBLEMS WITH ITS DISSEMINATION AND USE OF RESEARCH RATINGS
DATA INCLUDING RATINGS ACCURACY ISSUES REPORTED BY BROKERS
AND OTHER EMPLOYEES. FIRM PERSONNEL, HOWEVER, FAILED TO
TIMELY OR ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AS A RESULT, FIRM
MANAGEMENT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE TIMELY THAT SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT REASONABLE PRE-TRADE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AS
APPLIED TO CERTAIN ORDERS SUBMITTED BY CERTAIN OF ITS CLIENTS
OR TRADING DESKS, DESPITE THE VARIOUS PRE-TRADE CONTROLS
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS THAT THE
FIRM HAD IN PLACE.
THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND
IMPLEMENT REASONABLE SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO
PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS.
BECAUSE AT TIMES THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE CONTROLS WERE
UNREASONABLE AS APPLIED TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S CLIENTS OR
TRADING DESKS, IT FAILED TO PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN
ERRONEOUS EQUITY ORDERS TO THE CERTAIN SELF-REGULATORY
ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH CAUSED 12 CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EVENTS,
RESULTING IN THE FILING OF EIGHT CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EXECUTION
(CEE) PETITIONS FOR SIX OF THE EVENTS (FOUR EVENTS DID NOT
RESULT IN CEE PETITIONS). DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE
PRICE AND SIZE CONTROLS RESULTED IN THE SUBMISSION OF THE
ORDERS THAT CAUSED THE ERRONEOUS EVENTS.
MOREOVER, THE FIRM FAILED TO CAPTURE (I.E., RETAIN) WHEN SOFTBLOCKS FOR ERRONEOUS ORDERS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN,
AND THE FIRM FAILED TO REGULARLY REVIEW WHEN THESE TYPES OF
SOFT-BLOCKS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN.

MOREOVER, THE FIRM FAILED TO CAPTURE (I.E., RETAIN) WHEN SOFTBLOCKS FOR ERRONEOUS ORDERS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN,
AND THE FIRM FAILED TO REGULARLY REVIEW WHEN THESE TYPES OF
SOFT-BLOCKS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN.

User Guidance

THE FIRM FAILED IN RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT
REASONABLE CONTROLS THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF A SECURITY.
AT A POINT, THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE ERRONEOUS ORDER CONTROLS
WHOLLY FAILED TO APPLY, FOR AN ORDER ENTERED OUTSIDE OF
NORMAL TRADING HOURS AND IF A UNIQUE ORDER WAS THEREAFTER
BROKEN INTO MORE THAN ONE SMALLER ORDERS. ALSO, THE FIRM'S
PRE-TRADE SHARE QUANTITY CONTROL THAT APPLIED TO THESE
CONVERTED LIMIT ORDERS WAS NOT EFFECTIVE TO PREVENT THE
ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS.
THE FIRM UTILIZED A TYPE OF ALGORITHM THAT WAS DESIGNED TO
ALLOW THE DESK TO PLACE ORDERS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY BUY ONE
SECURITY WHILE SELLING ANOTHER SECURITY TO MINIMIZE THE
MARKET'S IMPACT ON BOTH LEGS OF THE TRADE.
THE ALGORITHM DID NOT POSSESS A PRE-TRADE CONTROL TO PREVENT
THE ENTRY OF AN ERRONEOUS ORDER WHERE A FIRM TRADER
ERRONEOUSLY ENTERED AN INCORRECT VALUE FOR ONE SIDE OF THE
PAIRING, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE ENTERING OF AN ERRONEOUS
ORDER WITH AN INCORRECT NUMBER OF SHARES. LATER, THE FIRM
IMPLEMENTED A HARD BLOCK THAT WAS TRIGGERED IF THE DIFFERENT
LEGS IN THE PAIR'S ALGORITHM DID NOT MAINTAIN A MINIMUM RATIO.
THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT PRIOR TO JUNE 2013, THE FIRM FAILED
TO CAPTURE OR RETAIN ANY INSTANCE IN WHICH A SOFT-BLOCK WAS
TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN. IN JUNE 2013, THE FIRM BEGAN
CAPTURING/RETAINING DATA REGARDING THE OCCURRENCE AND
OVERRIDES OF SOFT-BLOCKS FOR ERRONEOUS ORDERS AND CREDIT
LIMITS/CAPITAL THRESHOLDS. THE FIRM BEGAN TO REVIEW ANY
INSTANCE IN WHICH A SOFT-BLOCK FOR CREDIT LIMITS/CAPITAL
THRESHOLDS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN. HOWEVER, DURING
THE ENTIRE REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO REGULARLY REVIEW
INSTANCES IN WHICH SOFT-BLOCKS FOR POTENTIAL ERRONEOUS
ORDERS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN. THEREFORE IT WAS NOT
POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRM TO ASSURE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF
ITS RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
FOR THE PREVENTION OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS. MOREOVER, THE FIRM'S
FAILURES IN THIS REGARD ALSO PREVENTED THE FIRM FROM BEING
ABLE TO ADEQUATELY ADJUST THEIR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES TO
HELP ASSURE THEIR CONTINUED EFFECTIVENESS OR TO DETERMINE
WHETHER THERE WERE ANY WEAKNESSES IN THEIR CONTROLS OR
PROCEDURES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH,
DOCUMENT AND MAINTAIN A REASONABLE SYSTEM FOR REGULARLY

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT REASONABLE PRE-TRADE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AS
APPLIED TO CERTAIN ORDERS SUBMITTED BY CERTAIN OF ITS CLIENTS
OR TRADING DESKS, DESPITE THE VARIOUS PRE-TRADE CONTROLS
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS THAT THE
FIRM HAD IN PLACE. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO
ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT REASONABLE SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS.
BECAUSE AT TIMES THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE CONTROLS WERE
UNREASONABLE AS APPLIED TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S CLIENTS OR
TRADING DESKS, IT FAILED TO PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN
ERRONEOUS EQUITY ORDERS TO THE CERTAIN SELF-REGULATORY
ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH CAUSED 12 CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EVENTS,
RESULTING IN THE FILING OF EIGHT CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EXECUTION
(CEE) PETITIONS FOR SIX OF THE EVENTS (FOUR EVENTS DID NOT
RESULT IN CEE PETITIONS). DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE
PRICE AND SIZE CONTROLS RESULTED IN THE SUBMISSION OF THE
ORDERS THAT CAUSED THE ERRONEOUS EVENTS.
MOREOVER, THE FIRM FAILED TO CAPTURE (I.E., RETAIN) WHEN SOFTBLOCKS FOR ERRONEOUS ORDERS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN,
AND THE FIRM FAILED TO REGULARLY REVIEW WHEN THESE TYPES OF
SOFT-BLOCKS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM'S PRINCIPAL PROGRAM TRADING DESK
ENTERED A SERIES OF 56 ORDERS ON BEHALF OF A FIRM CLIENT IN AN
ATTEMPT TO CREATE A BASKET OF STOCKS (ERRONEOUS BASKET). THE
TRADING DESK ATTEMPTED TO HEDGE THE POSITION AND ENTERED ITS
HEDGE ORDER VIA ONE OF THE FIRM'S EXECUTION MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER PLACING THE ORDERS, A FIRM TRADER
ON THE FLOOR OF THE EXCHANGE REALIZED THAT THE FIRM'S
ALGORITHM HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MISCALCULATED THE BASKET AND THE
FIRM CANCELLED THE BASKET BEFORE THE ORDERS WERE EXECUTED.
WHILE NOT EXECUTED AND CANCELLED LESS THAN A MINUTE AFTER
ENTRY, THE ERRONEOUS BASKET ORDER INFORMATION WAS
DISSEMINATED BY THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC VIA ITS ORDER
IMBALANCE INFORMATION DATA FEED AND CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT
IMBALANCE NEAR THE CLOSE. THE LARGE IMBALANCES HAD THE EFFECT
OF EXERTING ARTIFICIAL DOWNWARD PRICING PRESSURE ON ALL 56
SYMBOLS. BECAUSE NO HARD-BLOCK EXISTED, THE SOFT-BLOCKS WERE
OVERRIDDEN AND THE BASKET WAS SENT ELECTRONICALLY FOR
EXECUTION WITHOUT BEING SUBJECTED TO ANY FURTHER REVIEW OR
CONTROLS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM FAILED TO RETAIN AND REVIEW THE
SOFT-BLOCKS THAT WERE TRIGGERED FOR THIS ERRONEOUS BASKET.
THE FIRM FAILED IN RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT
REASONABLE CONTROLS THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF A SECURITY.

THE FIRM UTILIZED A TYPE OF ALGORITHM THAT WAS DESIGNED TO
ALLOW THE DESK TO PLACE ORDERS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY BUY ONE
SECURITY WHILE SELLING ANOTHER SECURITY TO MINIMIZE THE
MARKET'S IMPACT ON BOTH LEGS OF THE TRADE.
THE ALGORITHM DID NOT POSSESS A PRE-TRADE CONTROL TO PREVENT
THE ENTRY OF AN ERRONEOUS ORDER WHERE A FIRM TRADER
ERRONEOUSLY ENTERED AN INCORRECT VALUE FOR ONE SIDE OF THE

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT REASONABLE PRE-TRADE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AS
APPLIED TO CERTAIN ORDERS SUBMITTED BY CERTAIN OF ITS CLIENTS
OR TRADING DESKS, DESPITE THE VARIOUS PRE-TRADE CONTROLS
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS THAT THE
FIRM HAD IN PLACE. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO
ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT REASONABLE SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS.
BECAUSE AT TIMES THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE CONTROLS WERE
UNREASONABLE AS APPLIED TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S CLIENTS OR
TRADING DESKS, IT FAILED TO PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN
ERRONEOUS EQUITY ORDERS TO THE CERTAIN SELF-REGULATORY
ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH CAUSED 12 CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EVENTS,
RESULTING IN THE FILING OF EIGHT CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EXECUTION
(CEE) PETITIONS FOR SIX OF THE EVENTS (FOUR EVENTS DID NOT
RESULT IN CEE PETITIONS). DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE
PRICE AND SIZE CONTROLS RESULTED IN THE SUBMISSION OF THE
ORDERS THAT CAUSED THE ERRONEOUS EVENTS.
MOREOVER, THE FIRM FAILED TO CAPTURE (I.E., RETAIN) WHEN SOFTBLOCKS FOR ERRONEOUS ORDERS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN,
AND THE FIRM FAILED TO REGULARLY REVIEW WHEN THESE TYPES OF
SOFT-BLOCKS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN.
THE FIRM FAILED IN RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT
REASONABLE CONTROLS THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF A SECURITY.

AT A POINT, THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE ERRONEOUS ORDER CONTROLS
WHOLLY FAILED TO APPLY, FOR AN ORDER ENTERED OUTSIDE OF

AT A POINT, THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE ERRONEOUS ORDER CONTROLS
WHOLLY FAILED TO APPLY, FOR AN ORDER ENTERED OUTSIDE OF
NORMAL TRADING HOURS AND IF A UNIQUE ORDER WAS THEREAFTER
BROKEN INTO MORE THAN ONE SMALLER ORDERS. ALSO, THE FIRM'S
PRE-TRADE SHARE QUANTITY CONTROL THAT APPLIED TO THESE
CONVERTED LIMIT ORDERS WAS NOT EFFECTIVE TO PREVENT THE
ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS.
THE FIRM UTILIZED A TYPE OF ALGORITHM THAT WAS DESIGNED TO
ALLOW THE DESK TO PLACE ORDERS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY BUY ONE
SECURITY WHILE SELLING ANOTHER SECURITY TO MINIMIZE THE
MARKET'S IMPACT ON BOTH LEGS OF THE TRADE.
THE ALGORITHM DID NOT POSSESS A PRE-TRADE CONTROL TO PREVENT
THE ENTRY OF AN ERRONEOUS ORDER WHERE A FIRM TRADER
ERRONEOUSLY ENTERED AN INCORRECT VALUE FOR ONE SIDE OF THE
PAIRING, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE ENTERING OF AN ERRONEOUS
ORDER WITH AN INCORRECT NUMBER OF SHARES. LATER, THE FIRM
IMPLEMENTED A HARD BLOCK THAT WAS TRIGGERED IF THE DIFFERENT
LEGS IN THE PAIR'S ALGORITHM DID NOT MAINTAIN A MINIMUM RATIO.
THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND
MAINTAIN A REASONABLE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM'S CLIENTS
COMPLIED WITH PRE-SET CREDIT LIMITS. FURTHER, UNTIL JUNE OF 2013,
THE FIRM WAS NOT RETAINING OR REVIEWING WHEN CREDIT LIMIT SOFTBLOCKS OCCURRED OR WAS BYPASSED, MAKING ITS SYSTEMS AND
CONTROLS UNREASONABLE.
THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH,
DOCUMENT AND MAINTAIN A REASONABLE SYSTEM FOR REGULARLY
REVIEWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS
AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES.

(CONTINUE FROM ALLEGATION SECTION)
ALTHOUGH THE FIRM PERIODICALLY REVIEWED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
ITS PRE-TRADE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY
PROCEDURES, BECAUSE THE FIRM WAS NEITHER CAPTURING NOR
REVIEWING, THE OCCURRENCE OR THE BYPASSING OF ITS SOFT-BLOCKS
PRIOR TO JUNE 2013, AND BECAUSE THE FIRM ALSO FAILED TO CONDUCT
A REGULAR REVIEW OF INSTANCES IN WHICH A SOFT-BLOCK WAS
TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN FOR POTENTIALLY ERRONEOUS ORDERS
DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRM TO
ASSURE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES FOR THE PREVENTION OF
ERRONEOUS ORDERS DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD. MOREOVER, THE
FIRM'S FAILURES IN THIS REGARD ALSO PREVENTED IT FROM BEING ABLE

WHETHER THERE WERE ANY WEAKNESSES IN THEIR CONTROLS OR

MOREOVER, THE FIRM FAILED TO CAPTURE (I.E., RETAIN) WHEN SOFTBLOCKS FOR ERRONEOUS ORDERS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN,
AND THE FIRM FAILED TO REGULARLY REVIEW WHEN THESE TYPES OF
SOFT-BLOCKS WERE TRIGGERED OR OVERRIDDEN.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM'S PRINCIPAL PROGRAM TRADING DESK
ENTERED A SERIES OF 56 ORDERS ON BEHALF OF A FIRM CLIENT IN AN
ATTEMPT TO CREATE A BASKET OF STOCKS (ERRONEOUS BASKET). THE
TRADING DESK ATTEMPTED TO HEDGE THE POSITION AND ENTERED ITS
HEDGE ORDER VIA ONE OF THE FIRM'S EXECUTION MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER PLACING THE ORDERS, A FIRM TRADER
ON THE FLOOR OF THE EXCHANGE REALIZED THAT THE FIRM'S
ALGORITHM HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MISCALCULATED THE BASKET AND THE
FIRM CANCELED THE BASKET BEFORE THE ORDERS WERE EXECUTED.
WHILE NOT EXECUTED AND CANCELED LESS THAN A MINUTE AFTER
ENTRY, THE ERRONEOUS BASKET ORDER INFORMATION WAS
DISSEMINATED BY THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC VIA ITS ORDER
IMBALANCE INFORMATION DATA FEED AND CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT
IMBALANCE NEAR THE CLOSE. THE LARGE IMBALANCES HAD THE EFFECT
OF EXERTING ARTIFICIAL DOWNWARD PRICING PRESSURE ON ALL 56
SYMBOLS. BECAUSE NO HARD-BLOCK EXISTED, THE SOFT-BLOCKS WERE
OVERRIDDEN AND THE BASKET WAS SENT ELECTRONICALLY FOR
EXECUTION WITHOUT BEING SUBJECTED TO ANY FURTHER REVIEW OR

SOFT-BLOCKS THAT WERE TRIGGERED FOR THIS ERRONEOUS BASKET.

SEC ADMIN RELEASE 33-10288, JANUARY 24, 2017: THE SEC DEEMS IT
APPROPRIATE THAT CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY
ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933 AGAINST CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS, INC. IN ANTICIPATION OF
THE INSTITUTION OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, RESPONDENT HAS
SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS
DETERMINED TO ACCEPT. SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE
PROCEEDINGS AND ANY OTHER PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OR ON

PARTY, AND WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS HEREIN,
EXCEPT AS TO THE COMMISSION'S JURISDICTION OVER IT AND THE

RESPONDENT CONSENTS TO THE ENTRY OF THIS ORDER INSTITUTING
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER. ON THE BASIS OF THIS ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S
OFFER, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT BETWEEN AUGUST 2010 AND JULY
2011, CERTAIN REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FIRM AND
CERTAIN REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES OF ANOTHER COMPANY
PRESENTED TO CERTAIN BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS AND ADVISORY
CLIENTS OF THE OTHER COMPANY (THE "RELEVANT INVESTORS") A
FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM WAS PITCHED
BOTH IN WRITING AND ORALLY TO INVESTORS BASED ON ITS PAST
PERFORMANCE AND RISK METRICS. THESE PRESENTATIONS, HOWEVER,
WERE RENDERED MATERIALLY MISLEADING BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO
ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE THAT THE RELEVANT INVESTORS COULD BE
PLACED INTO THE PROGRAM USING SUBSTANTIALLY MORE LEVERAGE
THAN WAS DISCLOSED AND THAT MARK-UPS WOULD BE CHARGED ON
EACH TRADE. THE UNDISCLOSED LEVERAGE AND MARKUPS CAUSED THE
RELEVANT INVESTORS TO SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF
THIS CONDUCT, THE FIRM VIOLATED SECTION 17(A)(2) OF THE
SECURITIES ACT.

CFTC PRESS RELEASE PR7516-17, JANUARY 19, 2017:
THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION ("COMMISSION") HAS
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC.
("RESPONDENT" OR "CITIGROUP") VIOLATED SECTION 4C(A)(5)(C) OF THE
COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT ("ACT" OR "CEA"), 7 U.S.C. § 6C(A)(5)(C)
(2012), AND COMMISSION REGULATION ("REGULATION") 166.3, 17 C.F.R. §
166.3 (2016), FROM AT LEAST JULY 16, 2011 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2012.
THEREFORE, THE COMMISSION DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE
PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS BE, AND
HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER RESPONDENT
ENGAGED IN THE VIOLATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN AND TO DETERMINE
WHETHER ANY ORDER SHOULD BE ISSUED IMPOSING REMEDIAL

WHETHER ANY ORDER SHOULD BE ISSUED IMPOSING REMEDIAL

BETWEEN JULY 16, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2012 ("RELEVANT PERIOD"),
CITIGROUP, BY AND THROUGH FIVE OF ITS TRADERS (WHO WORKED ON
EITHER ITS U.S. TREASURY OR U.S. SWAPS DESKS), ENGAGED IN
SPOOFING MORE THAN 2,500 TIMES IN VARIOUS CHICAGO MERCANTILE
EXCHANGE (CME) U.S. TREASURY FUTURES PRODUCTS DURING THE
RELEVANT PERIOD. ACCORDING TO THE ORDER, THE TRADERS'
SPOOFING STRATEGY INVOLVED PLACING BIDS OR OFFERS OF 1,000
LOTS OR MORE WITH THE INTENT TO CANCEL THOSE ORDERS BEFORE
EXECUTION. THE SPOOFING ORDERS WERE PLACED IN THE U.S.
TREASURY FUTURES MARKETS AFTER ANOTHER SMALLER BID OR OFFER
WAS PLACED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SAME OR A CORRELATED
FUTURES OR CASH MARKET, THE ORDER FINDS. THE TRADERS PLACED
THEIR SPOOFING ORDERS TO CREATE OR EXACERBATE AN IMBALANCE IN
THE ORDER BOOK AND CANCELLED THEIR SPOOFING ORDERS AFTER
EITHER THE SMALLER RESTING ORDERS HAD BEEN FILLED OR THE
TRADERS BELIEVED THAT THE SPOOFING ORDERS WERE AT TOO GREAT A
RISK OF BEING EXECUTED, THE ORDER FINDS. IN ADDITION TO
EXECUTING THE SPOOFING STRATEGY INDIVIDUALLY, ACCORDING TO THE
ORDER, ON AT LEAST ONE OCCASION, SOME OF CITIGROUP'S TRADERS
COORDINATED WITH EACH OTHER TO IMPLEMENT THE SPOOFING
STRATEGY, BY PLACING ONE OR MORE SPOOFING ORDERS AFTER
ANOTHER TRADER HAD PLACED ONE OR MORE SMALLER RESTING
ORDERS IN THE SAME OR A CORRELATED FUTURES OR CASH MARKET.
THE COMMISSION ALSO FOUND SEVERAL SUPERVISION FAILURES
RELATED TO CITIGROUP'S SPOOFING. FIRST, CITIGROUP PROVIDED
INSUFFICIENT TRAINING ABOUT SPOOFING TO TRADERS ON ITS U.S.
TREASURY AND U.S. SWAPS DESK. IN FACT, FOR MOST OF THE TRADERS
THROUGH WHICH CITIGROUP SPOOFED, THE ONLY COMMUNICATION
THEY RECEIVED ABOUT SPOOFING BEFORE OR DURING THE RELEVANT
PERIOD CONSISTED OF A SINGLE COMPLIANCE ALERT CONTAINING THE
ACT'S ANTI-SPOOFING LANGUAGE. SECOND, CITIGROUP DID NOT HAVE
ADEQUATE SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS IN PLACE TO DETECT SPOOFING BY
TRADERS ON ITS U.S. TREASURY AND U.S. SWAPS DESKS. THIRD, EVEN
WHEN ALERTED TO A SPOOFING INCIDENT INVOLVING ONE OF ITS
TRADERS, A SUPERVISOR AND OTHER MEMBERS ON THE U.S. TREASURY
DESK FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CITIGROUP'S THEN-EXISTING POLICIES
REGARDING REPORTING VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT.
BASED ON THE FOREGOING, CITIGROUP VIOLATED SECTION 4C(A)(5)(C)
OF THE ACT AND REGULATION 166.3.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT A REASONABLE SYSTEM OR PROCEDURE TO SUPERVISE ITS
PRICE VERIFICATION AND ENSURE ACCURATE VALUATIONS OF
SECURITIES. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT A FIRM TRADER WOULD
ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF A SECURITY THAT DID NOT HAVE AN EASILYIDENTIFIABLE MARKET PRICE. IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF
THESE PRICES, THE FIRM'S PRODUCT CONTROL GROUP COMPARED THE
TRADER'S MARKS TO PRICES THAT IT DERIVED FROM MARKET DATA. THE
FIRM COLLECTED THIS MARKET DATA FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES,
INCLUDING ITS MARKET MAKING DESKS, VENDOR PRICES, EXCHANGE
PRICES AND OTHER INTERNAL PRICING DATA. HOWEVER, THE FIRM'S
WSPS FAILED TO SET FORTH HOW THE PRODUCT CONTROL GROUP
SHOULD USE THIS INFORMATION TO CONDUCT ITS REVIEWS. THE FIRM
ALSO LACKED SYSTEMS, PROCEDURES AND WSPS TO MONITOR THE
QUALITY OF THE DATA IT RECEIVED FROM OUTSIDE VENDORS.
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE FIRM SEPARATELY PRICED THE
SAME SECURITIES USING THE SAME MARKET DATA, BUT APPLIED THE
DATA IN DIFFERENT WAYS, RESULTING IN THE SAME HARD-TO-VALUE
SECURITIES BEING PRICED DIFFERENTLY FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES.
THE FIRM LACKED SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT THE
PRICING DIFFERENCES WERE IDENTIFIED AND REASONABLE UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM USED A
SYSTEM KNOWN AS ITS FOCUS HAIRCUT SYSTEM TO AUTOMATICALLY
APPLY HAIRCUTS TO ITS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS)
POSITIONS IN ORDER TO CALCULATE ITS NET CAPITAL. THE FOCUS
HAIRCUT SYSTEM DETERMINED THE STATUS OF EACH MBS BASED ON
VARIOUS DATA FEEDS AND THEN APPLIED THE REQUIRED HAIRCUT. THE
SYSTEM ALLOWED FIRM PERSONNEL TO MANUALLY OVERRIDE HAIRCUTS
("HARD CODE") APPLIED BY THE SYSTEM. ONCE AN MBS WAS MANUALLY
HARD CODED BY FIRM PERSONNEL, THE FOCUS HAIRCUT SYSTEM
CONTINUED TO APPLY THE HARD CODED HAIRCUT INDEFINITELY,
WITHOUT ANY AUTOMATED NOTIFICATION OR RESET. AS RESULT, THE
FIRM APPLIED INCORRECT HAIRCUTS TO CERTAIN MBS THAT FELL TO
NON-INVESTMENT GRADE STATUS AFTER BEING HARD CODED BASED ON
THEIR PRIOR STATUS AS INVESTMENT GRADE MBS. THIS CAUSED THE
FIRM TO OVERSTATE ITS NET CAPITAL BY APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION
DOLLARS. SIMILARLY, ON 12 OTHER OCCASIONS, THE FIRM OVERSTATED
ITS NET CAPITAL BY UP TO $14.8 MILLION BECAUSE IT APPLIED
INCORRECT HAIRCUTS TO CERTAIN MBS POSITIONS. DURING THIS
PERIOD, THE FIRM LACKED ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AND
WSPS FOR MONITORING AND REVIEWING MANUAL OVERRIDES IN THE
HAIRCUT SYSTEM. THE FIRM DID NOT REQUIRE SUPERVISORY REVIEW OF
MANUAL OVERRIDES BEFORE THEY WERE MADE OR TRACK SUCH
OVERRIDES

HAIRCUT SYSTEM. THE FIRM DID NOT REQUIRE SUPERVISORY REVIEW OF
MANUAL OVERRIDES BEFORE THEY WERE MADE OR TRACK SUCH
OVERRIDES AFTER THEY HAD BEEN MADE TO ENSURE THAT THE HARD
CODED STATUS OF THOSE SECURITIES CONTINUED TO BE CORRECT. THE
FIRM DID REQUIRE MANUAL REVIEW OF HAIRCUTS APPLIED TO ALL NONGOVERNMENT SECURITIES WITH A MARKET VALUE OF $10 MILLION OR
MORE, INCLUDING THE HAIRCUTS RESULTING FROM MANUAL
OVERRIDES. HOWEVER, IT ASSIGNED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MANUAL
REVIEW TO THE SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO SUPERVISED THE INITIAL
HAIRCUT PROCESS. THIS REPRESENTED A COMPOUNDING CONTROL
WEAKNESS IN THE SUPERVISION OF HAIRCUT-RELATED PROCESSES. THE
FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM MAINTAINED INACCURATE
BOOKS AND RECORDS. SPECIFICALLY, ITS BOOKS AND RECORDS
REFLECTED THE INACCURATE NET CAPITAL COMPUTATIONS CAUSED BY
THE APPLICATION OF INCORRECT HAIRCUTS TO ITS MBS POSITIONS.
FINRA FOUND THAT THE FIRM POSTED BOND LOAN TRANSACTIONS AND
RELATED REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO THE SAME FIRM ACCOUNT.
AFTER THE POSITIONS WERE NETTED TOGETHER, THE STOCK RECORD
INCORRECTLY REFLECTED THE FIRM'S INVENTORY IN THESE POSITIONS.

STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS HAVE INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS INTO
THE PRACTICES OF CGMI AND OTHER FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH SA
REGISTRATIONS. THE MULTI-STATE INVESTIGATIONS FOCUSED ON
WHETHER SAS WERE PROPERLY REGISTERED IN THE RELEVANT
JURISDICTIONS AT THE TIME SUCH INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE ACCEPTED
CUSTOMER ORDERS FROM THOSE STATES. IN ADDITION, THE
INVESTIGATIONS FOCUSED ON WHETHER THE FIRMS' SUPERVISORY
SYSTEMS PROPERLY SUPERVISED SUCH ORDERS. IN CGMI'S CASE, THE
INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, SAS ACCEPTED
UNSOLICITED ORDERS FROM CLIENTS RESIDING IN STATES WHERE THE
SA WAS NOT REGISTERED. IN ADDITION, THE INVESTIGATIONS FOUND
THAT THE FIRM'S ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM DID NOT RECORD THE IDENTITY
OF THE PERSON RECEIVING THE ORDER FROM THE CUSTOMER FOR A
DISCREET SET OF ORDERS THAT WERE REVIEWED. FURTHERMORE, THE
INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT (A) CONTRARY TO APPLICABLE CGMI
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RSAS WERE NOT REGISTERED IN EVERY
STATE THAT THE FAS FOR WHOM THEY PROVIDED COVERAGE WERE
REGISTERED, AND AS A RESULT, (B) IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT CERTAIN
RSAS
ACCEPTED UNSOLICITED ORDERS IN NEW JERSEY AT TIMES WHEN THE
RSAS WERE NOT APPROPRIATELY REGISTERED IN NEW JERSEY.

ARISE FROM COMPLIANCE AND SURVEILLANCE FAILURES AT THE FIRM
INVOLVING TECHNOLOGICAL ERRORS THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES,
REMAINED UNDETECTED FOR YEARS. AS A RESULT OF THESE FAILURES,
THE FIRM VIOLATED PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS
RELATING TO ITS TRADE SURVEILLANCE AND ITS POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES CONCERNING PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS. OVER A PERIOD
OF APPROXIMATELY TEN YEARS, FROM 2002 THROUGH 2012, THE FIRM'S
MONITORING OF ITS TRADING, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY TRADING, WAS
INADEQUATE BECAUSE IT DID NOT MONITOR THOUSANDS OF TRADES
EXECUTED BY SEVERAL OF ITS TRADING DESKS. THE FAILURE
OCCURRED BECAUSE THE REPORTS THAT FIRM PERSONNEL USED TO
REVIEW TRADES WERE MISSING THOUSANDS OF TRADES. THESE
REPORTS WERE CREATED ELECTRONICALLY, AND SEVERAL TRADING
"PLATFORMS," OR ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS, THAT CONTAINED
INFORMATION ABOUT RELEVANT TRADES WERE OMITTED FROM THESE
TRADE REPORTS THAT THE FIRM USED FOR DAILY SURVEILLANCE. FROM
APPROXIMATELY OCTOBER 2007 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2010, THE FIRM
INADVERTENTLY ROUTED MORE THAN 467,000 TRANSACTIONS ON
BEHALF OF ADVISORY CLIENTS TO AN AFFILIATED MARKET MAKER,
AUTOMATED TRADING DESK FINANCIAL SERVICES LLC (ATD), WHICH
EXECUTED THE TRANSACTIONS AS PRINCIPAL AT OR NEAR PREVAILING
MARKET PRICES. THE FIRM ATTEMPTED TO AVOID PRINCIPAL
TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED THROUGH ATD BY DESIGNING POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES TO ROUTE ORDERS FROM INVESTMENT ADVISORY
CLIENTS (ADVISORY ORDERS) AWAY FROM ATD. HOWEVER, ITS POLICIES
AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED OR
IMPLEMENTED, AND FAILED TO DIVERT CERTAIN ADVISORY ORDERS AWAY
FROM ATD. MOREOVER, THE FIRM'S TRADE SURVEILLANCE FAILED TO
DETECT THESE PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS
BECAUSE IT RELIED ON AN EXCEPTION REPORT THAT WAS NOT
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO CAPTURE PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS
EXECUTED THROUGH ATD. THE FIRM FAILED TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE
ROUTING OF CERTAIN ADVISORY ORDERS TO ATD AND THE RESULTING
EXECUTION OF THOSE ORDERS BY ATD ON A PRINCIPAL BASIS. THE FIRM
WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 15(G) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND
SECTION 206(4) OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND RULE 206(4)-7 THEREUNDER.

SEC ADMIN RELEASE 33-9893/34-75710/IA RELEASE 4174/AUGUST 17, 2015:
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (COMMISSION) DEEMS IT
APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND
HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933 (SECURITIES ACT), SECTION 15(B)(4) OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT), AND SECTIONS 203(E) AND
203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (ADVISERS ACT)
AGAINST CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. (CGMI). THESE
PROCEEDINGS CONCERN MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS
MADE BY THE FIRM BETWEEN 2002 AND 2007 IN THE OFFER AND SALE OF
SECURITIES IN TWO NOW-DEFUNCT HEDGE FUNDS. THE ASTA/MAT AND
FALCON FUNDS WERE RECOMMENDED AND SOLD BY TWO GROUPS OF
INDIVIDUALS, THE "FINANCIAL ADVISERS" OF SMITH BARNEY AND THE
"PRIVATE BANKERS" OF CITIGROUP PRIVATE BANK (TOGETHER, THE
"FINANCIAL ADVISERS"), TO THEIR ADVISORY CLIENTS. THE FINANCIAL
ADVISERS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRM. BOTH FUNDS WERE
MANAGED BY A SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM'S AFFILIATE, WHICH ACTED
THROUGH ITS EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD A
PRIMARY ROLE IN CREATING THE FUNDS AND SERVING AS THE FUNDS'
MANAGER DURING THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD. THE FIRM RAISED
APPROXIMATELY $2.898 BILLION FROM APPROXIMATELY 4,000 INVESTORS
IN ASTA/MAT AND FALCON. IN 2008, BOTH FUNDS COLLAPSED RESULTING
IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOSSES. FROM 2002 THROUGH 2008,
FINANCIAL ADVISERS AND THE FUND MANAGER MISREPRESENTED THE
FUNDS' RISKS AND PERFORMANCE TO ADVISORY CLIENTS, WHO WERE
TOLD THAT THE INVESTMENTS WERE "SAFE," "LOW-RISK," "BOND
SUBSTITUTES" AND SUITABLE FOR TRADITIONAL BOND INVESTORS,
DESPITE STATEMENTS IN MARKETING DOCUMENTS THAT THE FUNDS
SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A BOND SUBSTITUTE. IN ADDITION, WHILE
THE RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS WAS DISCLOSED IN WRITTEN MATERIALS
PROVIDED TO CLIENTS, CERTAIN FINANCIAL ADVISERS AND THE FUND
MANAGER ORALLY MINIMIZED THE SIGNIFICANT RISK OF LOSS RESULTING
FROM, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FUNDS' INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND
USE OF LEVERAGE. INVESTORS WERE ALSO TOLD THAT THE BIGGEST
RISK FACING ASTA/MAT WAS THE ADOPTION OF A FLAT INCOME TAX BY
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FINANCIAL ADVISERS ENCOURAGED MANY
OF THEIR ADVISORY CLIENTS TO SELL PORTIONS OF THEIR BOND
PORTFOLIOS IN ORDER TO INVEST IN THE FUNDS. IN LATE 2007,
FINANCIAL ADVISERS AND THE FUND MANAGER CONTINUED TO OFFER
AND SELL FALCON AS A SAFE, LOW-RISK INVESTMENT, EVEN THOUGH
BOTH FUNDS BEGAN EXPERIENCING INCREASED MARGIN CALLS AND
LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 THAT CONTINUED

BOTH FUNDS BEGAN EXPERIENCING INCREASED MARGIN CALLS AND
LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 THAT CONTINUED
UNTIL THE FUNDS COLLAPSED. MOREOVER, THE FUND MANAGER WAS
INVOLVED IN VIRTUALLY ALL FUND-RELATED COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE
FINANCIAL ADVISERS AND INVESTORS. THE FUND MANAGER AND THE
FUND MANAGER'S STAFF WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAFTING AND
REVIEWING OFFERING MATERIALS FOR THE FUNDS, CRAFTING SALES
PITCHES TO INVESTORS, TRAINING THE SALES PERSONNEL OF THE
SUBSIDIARY, DRAFTING QUARTERLY INVESTOR REPORTS, DISCLOSING
INTERIM FUND PERFORMANCE, AND MANAGING THE FUNDS
THEMSELVES. FURTHERMORE, THROUGHOUT THE FUND OFFERINGS AND
FUND OPERATIONS, THE FUND MANAGER AND THE FUND MANAGER'S
STAFF AT THE SUBSIDIARY MET WITH PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS AND
RESPONDED DIRECTLY TO INQUIRIES FROM THE FINANCIAL ADVISERS
CONCERNING THE FUNDS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT GOVERNING
THOSE ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. THE FUND MANAGER AND HIS STAFF AT
THE SUBSIDIARY HAD SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE DISSEMINATION
OF INFORMATION RELATING TO THE FUNDS WITHOUT REVIEW OR
OVERSIGHT, INCLUDING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE FUNDS' RISKS
AND PERFORMANCE. THE SUBSIDIARY FAILED TO IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM
IN WHICH THE FUND MANAGER'S AUTHORITY WAS CHECKED ADEQUATELY
OR TO ENSURE THAT THE FUND MANAGER'S COMMUNICATIONS WITH
INVESTORS AND FINANCIAL ADVISERS CONCERNING THE ASTA/MAT AND
FALCON FUNDS WERE ACCURATE AND NOT MISLEADING. AS A RESULT,
THE FIRM WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTIONS 17(A)(2) AND 17(A)(3) OF THE
SECURITIES ACT AND SECTION 206(2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT.

REGULATION DETERMINED THAT DURING THE PERIOD OF JULY 2007
THROUGH OCTOBER 2014, THE FIRM VIOLATED SECTION 11(A)(1) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT) AND NYSE RULE

ASSOCIATES) WITH THE FIRM TO IMPROPERLY EFFECT TRANSACTIONS
FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT ON THE FLOOR OF THE EXCHANGE
(PROPRIETARY ORDERS) WITHOUT QUALIFYING FOR AN EXEMPTION.
FURTHER, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD, THE FIRM VIOLATED NYSE RULE
410(B) IN EXCESS OF 1,500 OCCASIONS, IN THAT IT ALLOWED THE ABOVE
REFERENCED PROPRIETARY ORDERS TO BE TRANSMITTED TO THE NYSE
FLOOR WITHOUT BEING IDENTIFIED IN A MANNER THAT WOULD ENABLE
THE ORDERS TO BE HANDLED PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF
EXCHANGE ACT SECTION 11(A)(1)(G). PROPRIETARY ORDERS THAT WERE
SENT TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT THE PROPER DESIGNATION COULD HAVE
POTENTIALLY RESULTED IN THE FIRM IMPROPERLY TRADING ITS
PROPRIETARY ORDERS AHEAD OF OR ALONGSIDE CUSTOMER ORDERS.
DURING THE PERIOD OF SEPTEMBER 2007 THROUGH APRIL 2013, THE
FIRM ALSO VIOLATED NYSE RULE 132(A) BY SUBMITTING INACCURATE
ACCOUNT TYPE INDICATOR (ATI) CODES FOR COMPARISON AND/OR
SETTLEMENT WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS EFFECTED ON THE
EXCHANGE ON MORE THAN APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION OCCASIONS. IN
CONNECTION WITH STAFF'S INVESTIGATION OF THE ABOVE-REFERENCED
CONDUCT, IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S
RECORDS OF ORDERS WERE INACCURATE BETWEEN JULY 2007 AND
APRIL 2013, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 17A-3 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND
NYSE RULE 440. THE ABOVE VIOLATIONS POTENTIALLY IMPACTED

Allegations:

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
DELIVER PROSPECTUSES IN CONNECTION WITH SALES OF CERTAIN ETFS
TO CUSTOMERS FROM 2009 THROUGH APRIL 2011. THE FIRM FAILED TO
DELIVER ETF PROSPECTUSES FOR APPROXIMATELY 255,000 CUSTOMER
PURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 160 ETFS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2010
TO NOVEMBER 2010 ALONE; THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD FOR WHICH THE
FIRM SELF-REPORTED THE ETF PROSPECTUS DELIVERY FAILURE.
CONSEQUENTLY, FROM 2009 THROUGH APRIL 2011, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT
THE FIRM MAY HAVE FAILED TO DELIVER PROSPECTUSES FOR OVER ONE
AND A HALF MILLION PURCHASES OF ETFS BY ITS CUSTOMERS. BASED
ON THE FOREGOING, THE FIRM ACTED IN CONTRAVENTION OF SECTION
5(B)(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND THEREBY VIOLATED NYSE RULES
1100(B), 476 AND 2010. THE FIRM WAS PREVIOUSLY SANCTIONED BY THE
NYSE IN 2007 FOR FAILURE TO DELIVER ETF PROSPECTUSES. THE FIRM
SELF-REPORTED THE ETF PROSPECTUS DELIVERY FAILURE TO FINRA IN
JANUARY 2011. THE FIRM FAILED TO REASONABLY SUPERVISE AND
IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE CONTROLS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH NYSE RULES
WITH RESPECT TO ETF PROSPECTUS DELIVERY. THE FIRM'S WRITTEN
SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES CONCERNING ETF PROSPECTUS DELIVERY
WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH
PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS. WHILE IT WAS REASONABLY
FORESEEABLE THAT A MANUAL PROCESS REQUIRED BY THE FIRM'S
WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES COULD RESULT IN HUMAN
ERRORS, THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES DID NOT
PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE FIRM COULD
DETECT AND PREVENT THESE ERRORS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM
EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT FAILURES TO DELIVER CERTAIN ETF
PROSPECTUSES DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE
FIRM VIOLATED NYSE RULES 342(A) AND (B), 476 AND 2010. IN ADDITION TO
DEFICIENT WRITTEN PROCEDURES, THE FIRM MAINTAINED A
DECENTRALIZED SUPERVISORY SYSTEM THAT WAS NOT REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PROSPECTUS DELIVERY
REQUIREMENTS OR TO ADDRESS ITS ETF PROSPECTUS DELIVERY
PROBLEMS THAT RESURFACED AFTER THE NYSE CERTIFICATION. THE

DECENTRALIZED SUPERVISORY SYSTEM THAT WAS NOT REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PROSPECTUS DELIVERY
REQUIREMENTS OR TO ADDRESS ITS ETF PROSPECTUS DELIVERY
PROBLEMS THAT RESURFACED AFTER THE NYSE CERTIFICATION. THE
2007 NYSE DISCIPLINARY ACTION, WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING
UNDERTAKING, PUT THE FIRM ON NOTICE THAT ETF PROSPECTUS
DELIVERY WAS AN AREA THAT REQUIRED FURTHER SUPERVISORY
DILIGENCE. DESPITE ITS EXECUTION OF THE UNDERTAKING, IN WHICH IT
CERTIFIED THAT ITS PROCEDURES IN THIS AREA (AND OTHERS) WERE
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND RULES,
THE FIRM DID NOT APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO RED FLAGS INDICATING
THAT IT HAD EXPERIENCED FAILURES TO DELIVER. HOWEVER, IN
JANUARY 2011, THE FIRM SELF-REPORTED THE ETF PROSPECTUS
DELIVERY FAILURES TO FINRA. BASED ON THE FOREGOING, THE FIRM
VIOLATED NYSE RULES 342 (A) AND (B), 476 AND 2010. ALSO, THE FIRM
VIOLATED NYSE RULE 342.23, 476 AND 2010 BY FAILING TO ESTABLISH A
SEPARATE SYSTEM OF FOLLOW-UP AND REVIEW TO DETERMINE THAT
THE DELEGATED AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY WERE BEING
PROPERLY EXERCISED AND TO VERIFY THAT ITS ETF PROSPECTUS
DELIVERY PROCEDURES WERE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO COMPLY
WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE FIRM
FAILED TO ADEQUATELY TEST ITS SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES FOR ETF
PROSPECTUS DELIVERY OR PREPARE REPORTS THAT WERE ADEQUATE
TO ADDRESS ETF PROSPECTUS DELIVERY TESTING AND VERIFICATION IN
2009 AND 2010. (CONT. IN COMMENT)

ALTHOUGH THE INTERNAL AUDIT DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED TESTING,
THE INTERNAL AUDIT PROGRAM DIRECTOR WHO OVERSAW THE AUDITS
WAS NOT AWARE OF THE 2007 NYSE DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND THE
RESULTING UNDERTAKING. THE FIRM'S ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REPORTS
FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS ETF PROSPECTUS DELIVERY TESTING

ANALYST'S DUE DILIGENCE, THAT THE COMPANY WOULD TAKE THE
PRESENTATION INTO ACCOUNT WHEN AWARDING THE UNDERWRITING

THE COMPANY WANTED A FINAL VALUATION THAT THE ENTIRE FIRM,

THE FIRM FAILED TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT WSPS REASONABLY

IT FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY DISCIPLINE ITS EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS,

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT
BONDSDIRECT, THE FIRM'S PROPRIETARY ORDER EXECUTION SYSTEM,
HAD A FLAWED PRICING LOGIC THAT ONLY INCORPORATED THE
QUOTATIONS FROM THE PRIMARY LISTING EXCHANGE FOR EACH
PARTICULAR NON-CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITY. AS A RESULT, IN
7,204 INSTANCES WHEN THERE WAS A BETTER PRICE ON A MARKET
OTHER THAN THE PRIMARY LISTING EXCHANGE, BONDSDIRECT
SYSTEMATICALLY EXECUTED TRANSACTIONS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS IN
NON-CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES AT PRICES THAT WERE
INFERIOR TO THE NATIONAL BEST BID AND OFFER (NBBO). THE FINDINGS
STATED THAT THE FIRM'S FIXED INCOME RETAIL PREFERRED TRADING
DESK (FIRPT DESK) TRADERS EMPLOYED A MANUAL PRICING
METHODOLOGY THAT DID NOT APPROPRIATELY INCORPORATE THE NBBO
FOR THE NON-CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES. AS A RESULT, IN
14,851 INSTANCES THE FIRM'S FIRPT DESK TRADERS MANUALLY PRICED
AND EXECUTED TRANSACTIONS IN NON-CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED
SECURITIES AT PRICES THAT WERE INFERIOR TO THE NBBO.
ACCORDINGLY, IN 22,055 TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM
FAILED TO USE REASONABLE DILIGENCE TO ASCERTAIN THE BEST INTERDEALER MARKET AND FAILED TO BUY OR SELL IN SUCH MARKET SO THAT
THE RESULTANT PRICE TO ITS CUSTOMER WAS AS FAVORABLE AS
POSSIBLE UNDER PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO

ACCORDINGLY, IN 22,055 TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM
FAILED TO USE REASONABLE DILIGENCE TO ASCERTAIN THE BEST INTERDEALER MARKET AND FAILED TO BUY OR SELL IN SUCH MARKET SO THAT
THE RESULTANT PRICE TO ITS CUSTOMER WAS AS FAVORABLE AS
POSSIBLE UNDER PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO
STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A
SUPERVISORY SYSTEM, INCLUDING WRITTEN SUPERVISORY
PROCEDURES (WSPS), THAT WAS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRM'S BEST EXECUTION OBLIGATIONS FOR
TRANSACTIONS IN NON-CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES
EXECUTED ON BONDSDIRECT OR MANUALLY BY FIRPT DESK TRADERS.
SPECIFICALLY, THE FIRM FAILED TO PERFORM ANY REVIEW OF NONCONVERTIBLE PREFERRED TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED ON BONDSDIRECT
OR MANUALLY BY THE FIRPT DESK TRADERS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE
WITH THE FIRM'S BEST EXECUTION OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM'S
SUPERVISORY SYSTEM DID NOT INCLUDE WSPS FOR A BEST EXECUTION
REVIEW OF NON-CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED
ON BONDSDIRECT OR THE FIRPT DESK PROVIDING FOR: THE
IDENTIFICATION OF THE PERSON(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPERVISION
WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICABLE RULES; A STATEMENT OF THE
SUPERVISORY STEP(S) TO BE TAKEN BY THE IDENTIFIED PERSON(S); A
STATEMENT AS TO HOW OFTEN SUCH PERSON(S) SHOULD TAKE SUCH
STEP(S); AND A STATEMENT AS TO HOW THE COMPLETION OF THE
STEP(S) INCLUDED IN THE WSPS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED. BETWEEN
JANUARY 2007 AND DECEMBER 2010, THE FIRM RECEIVED FIVE INQUIRY
LETTERS RELATED TO BEST EXECUTION VIOLATIONS. IN RESPONSE TO
THOSE INQUIRIES, THE FIRM ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CERTAIN
BONDSDIRECT AND MANUAL EXECUTIONS IN NON-CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED SECURITIES WERE OCCURRING AT PRICES THAT DID NOT
SATISFY THE EXISTING NBBO. DESPITE THESE RED FLAGS, THE FIRM
FAILED TO PERFORM ANY MEANINGFUL SUPERVISORY REVIEWS FOR
BEST EXECUTION OF NON-CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED TRANSACTIONS
EXECUTED ON BONDSDIRECT OR MANUALLY BY THE FIRPT DESK
TRADERS. MOREOVER, FINRA'S BEST EXECUTION REPORT CARDS WERE
AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM THROUGHOUT THE REVIEW PERIOD, WHICH
CONTAINED MANY OF THE BEST EXECUTION VIOLATIONS DESCRIBED
ABOVE. THE FIRM, HOWEVER, ONLY ATTEMPTED TO ACCESS ITS BEST
EXECUTION REPORT CARDS ONE TIME DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD.
ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DID NOT MAKE SUFFICIENT USE OF FINRA'S
BEST EXECUTION REPORT CARDS.

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT RULES 17A-3, 17A-5, FINRA RULE 2010, NASD
RULES 3010, 3110 - CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS, INC., AS PART OF ITS
BUSINESS STRATEGY TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME ASSETS,
LIQUIDATED CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS) BY
SELLING THE ASSETS HELD WITHIN THE CDOS AT AUCTION. THE LONG
TERM ASSET GROUP (LTAG) WITHIN THE FIRM PLACED RESERVE BIDS ON
ALL ASSETS AVAILABLE IN THE BLIND AUCTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM'S
BANKING AFFILIATE WAS THE SUPER SENIOR NOTEHOLDER. THE
RESERVE BIDS SET A MINIMUM PRICE FOR THE ASSETS AT THE LOWER
END OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE RANGE; AND ENSURED A SUCCESSFUL
AUCTION BECAUSE THE CDO COULD NOT BE DISSOLVED UNTIL ALL
ASSETS WERE DISTRIBUTED. BIDS WERE SUBMITTED WITHOUT PREAPPROVAL OF THE FIRM'S CAPITAL MARKETS APPROVAL COMMITTEE
(CMAC). THE FIRM DID NOT ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE LTAG TO ENSURE IT
BID FAIR MARKET VALUE ON ALL ASSETS AND LTAG ON OCCASION DID
NOT BID FAIR MARKET VALUE WHEN IT DECIDED THAT FAIR MARKET
VALUE COULD NOT BE ASSESSED IN TIME FOR THE AUCTION, WHEN IT
WOULD BID PAR. THE PAR BIDS SUBMITTED IN AUCTIONS SHIFTED
SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM THE BANKING AFFILIATE TO THE FIRM WHEN
THE PURCHASED ASSETS WERE MARKED TO THE COVER PRICE, WHICH
WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN PAR. LTAG DID NOT SEEK PERMISSION
FROM CMAC, OR NOTIFY ANY OF THE GROUPS REPRESENTED ON IT OF
THE DECISION TO BID PAR, AND THE CMAC REPRESENTATIVES REMAINED
UNAWARE OF THE LOSSES CAUSED UNTIL A LATER DATE. THE FIRM
FAILED TO ADDRESS CERTAIN RED FLAGS THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED
IT TO THE DAY-ONE LOSSES CAUSED BY BIDDING PAR ON THE CDO
ASSETS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVIDENT FROM A REVIEW OF LTAG'S
LIQUIDATION SUMMARIES AND PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENTS: LOSSES
INCREASED WHEN PAR BIDS WERE PLACED. THE FIRM INVESTIGATED
AND IDENTIFIED THE PAR BIDS AND RECORDED A ONE-TIME CAPITAL
CONTRIBUTION OF $464 MILLION TO THE BANKING AFFILIATE AND
REVERSED A $184 MILLION TAX LOSS BENEFIT RESULTING FROM ITS
PRIOR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. THE FIRM SUBSEQUENTLY SELFREPORTED THESE ISSUES TO FINRA. THE FIRM'S SUPERVISION OF LTAG
WAS INADEQUATE BECAUSE IT DID NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM IN
PLACE TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE
COMPETING ECONOMIC INTERESTS THAT AROSE WHEN LTAG BID FOR
FIRM ASSETS IN WHICH THE BANKING AFFILIATE HAD A BENEFICIAL

MSRB RULES G-17, G-27- CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. WAS A
MEMBER OF A MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ASSOCIATION WHICH REQUESTED
THAT ITS MEMBERS MAKE UNDERWRITING ASSESSMENT PAYMENTS OF
$0.01 PER BOND, AND LATER $0.02 PER BOND, WHEN THEY PARTICIPATED
IN BOND ISSUANCES IN CALIFORNIA OF MORE THAN $2 MILLION IN ISSUE
SIZE WITH MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO MATURITY. THE MUNICIPAL
SECURITIES ASSOCIATION'S MISSION WAS TO KEEP ITS MEMBERS
INFORMED OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
AFFECTING THE MUNICIPAL SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND TO PROVIDE A
FORUM THROUGH WHICH THE MUNICIPAL SECURITIES INDUSTRY COULD
REVIEW AND RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS. THE ASSOCIATION
BILLED ITS MEMBERS ON THE PER-BOND BASIS, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THERE WAS ANY DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT BOND
ISSUANCE AND THE ASSOCIATION'S ACTIVITIES, AND REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THE ASSOCIATION PROVIDED ANY SERVICES REQUIRED FOR
THE UNDERWRITING. THE FIRM PAID THE ASSOCIATION A TOTAL OF
$487,721.78 FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE UNDERWRITING OF
APPROXIMATELY 323 APPLICABLE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM OBTAINED
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE VOLUNTARY PAYMENTS FROM THE PROCEEDS
OF MUNICIPAL AND STATE BOND OFFERINGS WHICH WAS UNFAIR. THE
ASSESSMENTS DID NOT HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO ANY ACTIVITIES
CONDUCTED WITH RESPECT TO EACH BOND OFFERING. THE FIRM WAS
NOT REQUIRED BY ANY STATUTE OR REGULATION TO BE A MEMBER OF
THE ASSOCIATION YET TREATED ITS ASSESSMENTS AS AN EXPENSE OF
EACH TRANSACTION AND REQUESTED AND RECEIVED REIMBURSEMENT
OF THE PAYMENTS FROM THE PROCEEDS OF EACH BOND OFFERING.
THE FIRM LISTED THE UNDERWRITING ASSESSMENTS AS EXPENSES OF
THE UNDERWRITING BUT ITS REQUESTS FOR REIMBURSEMENT WERE
NOT FAIR BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY ADEQUATE
DISCLOSURE TO ISSUERS. THE FIRM'S PRACTICES RESULTED IN THE
EXPENDITURE OF THE PROCEEDS OF MUNICIPAL AND STATE BOND
OFFERINGS TO AN ORGANIZATION ENGAGED IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. IN
RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE TREASURER OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA, THE FIRM HAS RETURNED $96,615.25 TO MULTIPLE ISSUERS
AS A REFUND FOR THE UNDERWRITING ASSESSMENTS REIMBURSED
FROM OFFERING PROCEEDS. THE FIRM FAILED TO ADOPT, MAINTAIN AND
ENFORCE WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS) REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH MSRB RULE G-17. THE FIRM
ALSO FAILED TO ADOPT, MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE ADEQUATE SYSTEMS
AND WSPS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO MONITOR HOW THE MUNICIPAL
SECURITIES ASSOCIATIONS TO WHICH IT BELONGED USED THE FUNDS
THAT THE FIRM PROVIDED. ADEQUATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
WERE ESPECIALLY NECESSARY IN LIGHT OF ONE ASSOCIATION'S
ENGAGEMENT IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.

Regulator Statement

ALLEGATIONS CONTINUED: THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND
MAINTAIN WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ADDRESSING
INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION FOR ITS PRICING OF ITS
COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION (CDO)SECURITIES AND FAILED TO
SUFFICIENTLY DOCUMENT ITS PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR CDO
SECURITIES. THE FIRM UTILIZED A STALE PRICE REPORT TO IDENTIFY
SECURITIES FOR WHICH NO PRICE CHANGE WAS REFLECTED IN ITS
PRICING DATABASE FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS. CERTAIN SUBPRIME
SECURITIES FINANCED BY THE FIRM AND HAND-PRICED BY ITS TRADERS
FAILED TO BE INCLUDED ON THE REPORT EVEN THOUGH THE PRICES
ASSIGNED TO THOSE SECURITIES HAD NOT CHANGED FOR THE
SPECIFIED NUMBER OF DAYS. THE FIRM COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT
IT HAD NOT UTILIZED STALE PRICES FOR SUCH SECURITIES IN ITS
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WHEN A CUSTOMER QUESTIONED THE ACCURACY
OF A MARGIN CALL RESULTING FROM ITS PRICING OF A MORTGAGEBACKED SECURITY, IT RE-PRICED THE SECURITY, THEREBY REDUCING OR
ELIMINATING THE MARGIN CALL. THE FIRM FAILED TO MAINTAIN A RECORD
OF THE MARGIN CALL AS ORIGINALLY CALCULATED BEFORE THE REPRICING AND DOCUMENTATION OF SUPERVISORY APPROVAL FOR THE
RE-PRICING. THE FIRM WAS UNABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE
REVISED PRICE HAD BEEN UNIFORMLY APPLIED TO OTHER POSITIONS, IF
ANY, IN THE SAME SECURITY HELD THROUGHOUT THE FIRM. THE FIRM
MAINTAINED STANDARD GUIDANCE CONCERNING MARGIN HAIRCUTS TO
BE APPLIED TO CERTAIN ASSETS BUT IN LIMITED INSTANCES, MARGIN
HAIRCUTS LOWER THAN THOSE IN THE FIRM GUIDANCE WERE APPLIED
TO REVERSE PURCHASE CONTRACTS. THE FIRM COULD NOT
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE APPROPRIATE MARGIN CALLS HAD BEEN
ISSUED AND REQUIRED MARGIN COLLECTED. THE FIRM ALSO FAILED TO
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN WRITTEN SUPERVISORY POLICIES AND
PROCEDURE FOR SUPERVISORY REVIEW, AND DOCUMENTED
SUPERVISORY APPROVAL OF THE APPLICATION OF MARGIN HAIRCUTS TO
COLLATERAL. THE FIRM FAILED TO SUPERVISE IN CONNECTION WITH ALL

("FINRA") ISSUED A LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE, WAIVER AND CONSENT
("AWC") AGAINST CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. ("CGMI") RELATING
TO CGMI'S ROLE IN THE PROVISION OF PERFORMANCE DATA RELATED TO
MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS. FINRA ALLEGED THAT FROM JANUARY
2006 THROUGH OCTOBER 2007, CGMI POSTED INACCURATE
PERFORMANCE DATA AND STATIC POOL INFORMATION TO THE REG AB
WEBSITE OF CITIGROUP INC. (AN INDIRECT 100% OWNER OF CGMI) IN
CONNECTION WITH NUMEROUS SECURITIZATIONS, AND CGMI FAILED TO
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE SUPERVISORY AND OPERATIONAL
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REGARDING THESE ISSUES. FINRA
FURTHER ALLEGED THAT INACCURATE DATA REMAINED ON THE
CITIGROUP REG AB WEBSITE THROUGH MAY 2012. AS A RESULT, FINRA
ALLEGED THAT CGMI VIOLATED NASD RULES 2210 AND FINRA RULE 2010
FOR FAILING TO OBSERVE HIGH STANDARDS OF COMMERCIAL HONOR
AND JUST AND EQUITABLE PRINCIPLES OF TRADE. FINRA ALSO ALLEGES
THAT, BY VIRTUE OF THIS SAME CONDUCT, CGMI FAILED TO SUPERVISE IN

SUPERVISORY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ADDRESSING INDEPENDENT
PRICE VERIFICATION OF LEVEL 3 COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION
SECURITIES, AND TO DOCUMENT PRICE VERIFICATION FOR SUCH
SECURITIES; (B) TO INCLUDE CERTAIN SECURITIES FOR WHICH NO PRICE
CHANGE HAD OCCURRED OVER SEVERAL DAYS ON AN INTERNAL "STALE
PRICE REPORT"; (C) TO SUPERVISE AND SUFFICIENTLY DOCUMENT
CERTAIN RE-PRICINGS OF SECURITIES HELD ON MARGIN THAT LED TO
REVISED MARGIN CALLS; AND (D) TO SUPERVISE AND SUFFICIENTLY
DOCUMENT THE APPLICATION OF "MARGIN HAIRCUTS" TO COLLATERAL
OUTSIDE OF HAIRCUT RANGES REFLECTED IN CGMI'S GUIDANCE. AS A
RESULT, FINRA ALLEGED THAT CGMI VIOLATED RULES 17A-3(A)(8) AND
RULE 17A-4 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND NASD
RULES 3110 AND 2110. IN ADDITION, FINRA ALLEGED THAT BY VIRTUE OF

Allegations:

SEC RULE 17A-4, FINRA RULE 2010, NASD RULES 2110, 3010, 3110: DURING
THE PERIOD OCTOBER 21, 2008 TO DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE FIRM FAILED
TO RETAIN MILLIONS OF EMAILS, INCLUDING EMAILS NOT RETAINED THAT
POTENTIALLY IMPACTED THE FIRM'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO EMAIL
REQUESTS IN FINRA INVESTIGATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS. THE FIRM,
THROUGH ITS FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANY, BEGAN TO
IMPLEMENT AN UPGRADE OF ITS EMAIL ARCHIVING SYSTEM FROM A
BACKUP TAPE-BASED SYSTEM TO A NEW JOURNALING-BASED SYSTEM.
THE JOURNALING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION THROUGH THE
USE OF THREE COMPONENT SERVERS: A MAIL SERVER, A HUB
TRANSPORT SERVER, AND A JOURNALING SERVER. IN ALL, THE
UPGRADED EMAIL ARCHIVING SYSTEM UTILIZED 58 MAIL SERVERS IN
NORTH AMERICA. HOWEVER, THREE OF THE 58 MAIL SERVERS DID NOT
FUNCTION AS EXPECTED AND FAILED TO PROPERLY TRANSMIT EMAILS TO
THE ARCHIVE FOR ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS ASSIGNED TO THOSE MAIL
SERVERS DURING PART OR ALL OF THE RELEVANT PERIOD. AS A RESULT
OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AFFECTED SERVERS, THE
FIRM FAILED TO RETAIN EMAILS SENT OR RECEIVED BY APPROXIMATELY
2,800 ASSOCIATED PERSONS THAT RESIDED ON THE THREE AFFECTED
SERVERS DURING PARTS OR ALL OF THE RELEVANT PERIOD. NOT ALL OF
THE AFFECTED ASSOCIATED PERSONS WERE ON AN AFFECTED SERVER
FOR THE ENTIRE 14 MONTH RELEVANT PERIOD, BECAUSE TWO OF THE
AFFECTED SERVERS WERE NOT PLACED INTO USE UNTIL MONTHS AFTER
THE BEGINNING OF THE RELEVANT PERIOD, AND BECAUSE SOME USERS
WERE MIGRATED ONTO AND OFF THE THREE AFFECTED SERVERS AT
DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. CERTAIN OF THE
EMAILS SENT OR RECEIVED BY THE AFFECTED ASSOCIATED PERSONS
DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD WERE ULTIMATELY RETAINED BY THE
FIRM BECAUSE THE EMAILS THEMSELVES MAY HAVE INCLUDED OTHER
EMAIL USERS THAT WERE NOT ON ONE OF THE THREE AFFECTED
SERVERS. EMAILS THAT THE FIRM WAS REQUIRED TO RETAIN WERE NOT
ARCHIVED IF THEY WERE EXCLUSIVELY BETWEEN AN AFFECTED

www.finra.org/brokercheck

EMAILS SENT OR RECEIVED BY THE AFFECTED ASSOCIATED PERSONS
DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD WERE ULTIMATELY RETAINED BY THE
FIRM BECAUSE THE EMAILS THEMSELVES MAY HAVE INCLUDED OTHER
EMAIL USERS THAT WERE NOT ON ONE OF THE THREE AFFECTED
SERVERS. EMAILS THAT THE FIRM WAS REQUIRED TO RETAIN WERE NOT
ARCHIVED IF THEY WERE EXCLUSIVELY BETWEEN AN AFFECTED
ASSOCIATED PERSON AND: (I) OTHER AFFECTED ASSOCIATED PERSONS;
(II) OTHER EMPLOYEES OF THE HOLDING COMPANY WITHIN NORTH
AMERICA WHO ALSO RESIDED ON AN AFFECTED SERVER; (III) OTHER
HOLDING COMPANY EMPLOYEES ON EMAIL SERVERS OUTSIDE NORTH
AMERICA WHOSE EMAILS WERE NOT BEING ARCHIVED; AND/OR (IV)
INDIVIDUALS EXTERNAL TO THE HOLDING COMPANY. IT WAS NOT
POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY THE NUMBER OF EMAILS THAT
WERE NOT RETAINED BY THE FIRM BECAUSE EMAILS FROM THE THREE
AFFECTED SERVERS MAY HAVE BEEN COPIED TO UNAFFECTED SERVERS
AND THEREBY BEEN ARCHIVED. THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AND
PROCEDURES RELATING TO THE RETENTION OF ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATIONS WERE DEFICIENT IN THAT THEY FAILED TO TIMELY
DETECT THE EMAIL RETENTION FAILURES, AND AS A RESULT, DID NOT
ENSURE THAT EMAILS WERE BEING ADEQUATELY REVIEWED. THE FIRM,
THROUGH THE HOLDING COMPANY, FAILED TO PERFORM SUFFICIENT
QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) TESTS PRIOR TO MIGRATING LIVE USERS
ONTO ITS UPGRADED EMAIL ARCHIVING SYSTEM. DURING THE INITIAL
STAGES OF THE EMAIL ARCHIVING UPGRADE PROCESS, THE QA TESTING
WAS A MANUAL PROCESS THAT WAS INSUFFICIENTLY DESIGNED IN THAT
IT FAILED TO DETECT THE UNPOPULATED DISTRIBUTION LISTS ON THE
HUB SERVERS AND THE FACT THAT THE JOURNALING FUNCTION WAS
NEVER TURNED BACK ON. THOUGH AN AUTOMATED QA PROCESS WAS
SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED THAT WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED THESE
EMAIL ARCHIVING PROBLEMS, THE FIRM, THROUGH THE HOLDING
COMPANY, FAILED TO APPLY THIS AUTOMATED QA PROCESS TO EACH OF
ITS 58 MAIL SERVERS, INCLUDING THE THREE AFFECTED SERVERS.

Regulator Statement

[CONTINUED FROM ALLEGATIONS]: FURTHERMORE, AFTER THE FIRM,
THROUGH ITS HOLDING COMPANY, HAD COMPLETED THE ENTIRE EMAIL
ARCHIVING UPGRADE PROCESS FOR ALL 58 SERVERS, THE MONITORING
SOFTWARE THAT WAS USED TO CHECK WHETHER THE JOURNALING
PROCESS WAS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY
DESIGNED TO FLAG REASONABLY FORESEEABLE ERRORS. IT WAS NOT
UNTIL THE FALL OF 2009, WHEN CUSTOMIZED CONFIGURATION
MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE THAT EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATED WITH A
CENTRAL HOLDING COMPANY DIRECTORY WAS DEVELOPED, THAT THE
FIRM, THROUGH THE HOLDING COMPANY, WAS ABLE TO FLAG THAT THE
THREE AFFECTED SERVERS WERE PROBLEMATIC. THE FIRM'S EMAIL
RETENTION DEFICIENCIES POTENTIALLY IMPACTED AT LEAST FIVE FINRA
INVESTIGATIONS FOR WHICH EMAIL OF AN AFFECTED ASSOCIATED
PERSON WAS REQUESTED. FURTHER, THE FIRM'S EMAIL RETENTION
DEFICIENCIES MAY HAVE IMPACTED ITS ABILITY TO PRODUCE EMAILS
FULLY RESPONSIVE TO REQUESTS IN OTHER MATTERS.

SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE
17A-3, NASD RULES 2110, 3010, 3012(2)(A), 3110: THE FIRM FAILED TO
DETECT OR RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO A SERIES OF RED FLAGS THAT
UPON FURTHER INQUIRY WOULD HAVE ALERTED THE FIRM TO A FORMER
REGISTERED SALES ASSISTANT'S IMPROPER USE OF CUSTOMER FUNDS,
INCLUDING INDICATIONS OF IRREGULARITIES IN CERTAIN EXCEPTION
REPORTS, LETTERS OF AUTHORIZATION (LOAS), "POTENTIAL BOUNCED
CHECK" NOTICES, EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYEE-RELATED ACCOUNTS AND
NEW ACCOUNT APPLICATIONS. THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY LAPSES AT HER BRANCH TO
FACILITATE HER WRONGFUL TAKING OF CUSTOMER FUNDS BY
TARGETING ELDERLY, ILL OR OTHERWISE VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS
WHOM SHE BELIEVED WERE UNABLE TO MONITOR THEIR ACCOUNTS.
UPON INVESTIGATION, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THE FORMER SALES
ASSISTANT MISAPPROPRIATED $749,978 FROM 22 CUSTOMERS, FALSIFIED
NUMEROUS ACCOUNT RECORDS AND ENGAGED IN UNAUTHORIZED
TRADES IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. THE EXCEPTION REPORTS ARE ONE
OF THE SUPERVISORY TOOLS USED BY THE FIRM TO DETECT RED FLAGS
IN NEW ACCOUNT APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING INFORMATION THAT MAY BE
INACCURATE AND FRAUDULENT. THE EXCEPTION REPORTS ARE
DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE FIRM THE EXISTENCE OF MISMATCHES
BETWEEN NEW ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION KEPT IN A
THIRD-PARTY DATABASE. THE FIRM RELIED ON UNVERIFIED RESPONSES
PROVIDED BY THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT TO RESOLVE THE
EXCEPTION REPORT MISMATCHES, EVEN WHEN SOME RESPONSES DID
NOT ADDRESS THE DISCREPANCY NOTED IN THE EXCEPTION REPORTS.
THE FIRM, WITHOUT FURTHER INQUIRY, ACCEPTED THE FORMER SALES
ASSISTANT'S EXPLANATIONS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE CONTINUED
SUCCESS OF HER SCHEME TO MISAPPROPRIATE CUSTOMER FUNDS.
FURTHER, THE FIRM WOULD FAIL TO FOLLOW UP TO DETERMINE
WHETHER THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT HAD APPROPRIATELY
RESOLVED THE PROBLEM, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO HER BEING ABLE TO
OPEN FALSE ACCOUNTS TO FACILITATE HER MISAPPROPRIATION OF
CUSTOMER FUNDS. LOAS AUTHORIZE THE FIRM TO EFFECT TRANSFERS
OF FUNDS, DISBURSEMENTS AND CHANGES TO ACCOUNT INFORMATION,
INCLUDING ADDRESS CHANGES. THE FIRM FAILED TO DETECT PATTERNS
OF IRREGULAR AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY INVOLVING TRANSFERS,
DISBURSEMENTS AND ADDRESS CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS USED BY THE
FORMER SALES ASSISTANT TO MISAPPROPRIATE CUSTOMER FUNDS. THE
FIRM ALSO FAILED TO DETECT OR INVESTIGATE RED FLAGS CONCERNING
IRREGULAR "MONEY IN, MONEY OUT" PATTERNS AS REFLECTED IN LOAS.
THE FIRM CONSIDERS "POTENTIAL BOUNCED CHECK" NOTICES AN

THE FIRM CONSIDERS "POTENTIAL BOUNCED CHECK" NOTICES AN
INDICATION OF AN EMPLOYEE'S POSSIBLE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND
INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF FRAUD. THE BRANCH WAS NOTIFIED ON 20
SEPARATE OCCASIONS THAT THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT'S ACCOUNT
POTENTIALLY HAD INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PAY THE CHECKS
PRESENTED AGAINST THE ACCOUNT. DESPITE MULTIPLE RED FLAGS, THE
FIRM FAILED TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO FOLLOW UP OR
INVESTIGATE THE COMPLIANCE ISSUES RAISED BY THE FORMER SALES
ASSISTANT'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED THAT
EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS PRESENT UNIQUE COMPLIANCE RISKS AND THUS
REQUIRE HEIGHTENED SUPERVISORY REVIEW. THE FIRM ADOPTED A
POLICY TO CODE EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS WITH A SEPARATE NUMBER
RANGE SO THAT MANAGERS COULD MORE CAREFULLY MONITOR THESE
ACCOUNTS. THE FIRM FAILED TO ASSIGN THE APPROPRIATE CODE TO AN
ACCOUNT CREATED BY THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT IN THE NAME OF
HER FATHER. THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO CODE AND REASONABLY MONITOR
THE ACCOUNT PREVENTED THE FIRM FROM DETECTING MULTIPLE RED
FLAGS CONCERNING THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT'S MISCONDUCT.
THE FIRM'S REVIEW OF NEW ACCOUNT APPLICATIONS WAS EQUALLY
DEFICIENT. HAD ANYONE AT THE BRANCH REVIEWED THE NEW ACCOUNT
INFORMATION OF THE ACCOUNT IN THE NAME OF THE FORMER SALES
ASSISTANT'S FATHER BY COMPARING IT TO EXISTING ACCOUNT RECORDS
FOR THE FATHER, THE DISCREPANCY WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
AND COULD HAVE ALERTED THE FIRM TO THE FORMER SALES
ASSISTANT'S MISCONDUCT. [CONTINUED IN COMMENT]

Regulator Statement

[CONTINUED FROM ALLEGATIONS]: THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT
CREATED AN ACCOUNT IN THE NAME OF A DECEASED CUSTOMER EVEN
AFTER THE FIRM HAD BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS
DECEASED. SHE SUBSEQUENTLY CREATED A FALSE ACCOUNT IN THE
NAME OF ANOTHER CUSTOMER, THE DECEASED CUSTOMER'S WIDOW.
THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT CAUSED CHECKS TO BE ISSUED FROM
THE WIDOW'S ACCOUNT TO HER PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNT. THE FIRM'S
REVIEW OF NEW ACCOUNT APPLICATIONS WAS DEFICIENT AND
PREVENTED THE FIRM FROM DETECTING RED FLAGS CONCERNING THE
FORMER SALES ASSISTANT'S MISCONDUCT. THE FIRM FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT A REASONABLE SYSTEM CONCERNING THE SUPERVISION OF
EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS AND ACCOUNTS DEEMED ABANDONED PROPERTY.
THE FIRM ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR
EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS TO ESCAPE REASONABLE SUPERVISORY REVIEW
BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY CODED. THE FIRM ALSO
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CERTAIN EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS WERE
IMPROPERLY CODED DUE TO AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS GLITCH. THE FIRM'S
SUPERVISION OF ACCOUNTS AT THE BRANCH DEEMED ABANDONED
PROPERTY WAS ALSO DEFICIENT. THE FIRM DEEMED ACCOUNTS
ABANDONED PROPERTY WHEN ACCOUNT STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN
RETURNED TO THE FIRM OR WHERE THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTIVITY IN
THE ACCOUNT FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM
DEEMED A CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNTS ABANDONED AND THE FORMER
REGISTERED SALES ASSISTANT GAINED ACCESS TO THESE ACCOUNTS,
ENGAGED IN UNAUTHORIZED TRADES AND MISAPPROPRIATED AT LEAST
$48,000 IN CUSTOMER FUNDS. THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO MONITOR
ACCOUNTS DEEMED ABANDONED PROPERTY IN A REASONABLE MANNER
PREVENTED THE FIRM FROM DETECTING AND PREVENTING THE FORMER
REGISTERED SALES ASSISTANT'S MISCONDUCT. THE FIRM FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT REASONABLE CONTROLS REGARDING THE SUPERVISORY
REVIEW OF ACTIVITY IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING THE REVIEW
OF CERTAIN EXCEPTION REPORTS AND EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS.
ALTHOUGH THE FIRM USED ITS RISK AND CONTROL SELF-ASSESSMENT
(RCSA) AND BRANCH EXAMINATIONS TO TEST SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AT
THE BRANCH LEVEL, IT FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS IDENTIFIED
DEFICIENCIES. THE FIRM, THROUGH ITS RCSA OF THE BRANCH FOR THE
FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, RATED THE REVIEW OF EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS
AS "UNSATISFACTORY." DESPITE THIS LOW RATING, THE FIRM DID NOT
PRODUCE
EVIDENCE
THAT THE
©2019 FINRA. All rights reserved. Report about
CITIGROUP

REASONABLE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCY.

(RCSA) AND BRANCH EXAMINATIONS TO TEST SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AT
THE BRANCH LEVEL, IT FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS IDENTIFIED
DEFICIENCIES. THE FIRM, THROUGH ITS RCSA OF THE BRANCH FOR THE
FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, RATED THE REVIEW OF EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS
AS "UNSATISFACTORY." DESPITE THIS LOW RATING, THE FIRM DID NOT
PRODUCE EVIDENCE THAT THE BRANCH HAD IMPLEMENTED A
REASONABLE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCY.
SIMILARLY, IN THE FIRM'S BRANCH EXAMINATION REPORT ISSUED DURING
THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, THE FIRM AGAIN IDENTIFIED THE REVIEW
OF EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS AS AN EXCEPTION. ALTHOUGH THE BRANCH
CORRECTED THE CODING ON THE EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS IDENTIFIED IN
THE REPORT, IT FAILED TO IMPLEMENT A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TO
ADDRESS THE BROADER DEFICIENCY. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM'S SOLE
MEANS OF IDENTIFYING EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS WAS THROUGH
NOTIFICATION BY THE EMPLOYEE. DESPITE A ROUTINE ANNUAL
CERTIFICATION BY EMPLOYEES IDENTIFYING ALL EMPLOYEE-RELATED
ACCOUNTS, THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO ENSURE
THAT THE ACCOUNTS IDENTIFIED BY THE EMPLOYEES WERE PROPERLY
CODED ON THE FIRM'S SYSTEM. THE FIRM, THROUGH RCSA OF THE
BRANCH FOR THE THIRD QUARTER 2006, RATED THE REVIEW OF
EXCEPTION REPORTS AT THE BRANCH AS "UNSATISFACTORY." THE FIRM
HAS SAMPLED ACCOUNTS AT THE BRANCH AND NOTED THAT IN SOME
CASES MISMATCHES HAD NOT BEEN RECTIFIED AND NO FOLLOW-UP HAD
OCCURRED. IN OTHER CASES, WHERE SOME FOLLOW-UP DID OCCUR,
THE MISMATCHES AND SUSPECT CUSTOMER INFORMATION HAD NOT
BEEN RECTIFIED. THE FIRM FAILED TO MAKE AND KEEP ACCURATE
RECORDS FOR EACH CUSTOMER ACCOUNT AND THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO
SUPERVISE THE FORMER SALES ASSISTANT ENABLED HER TO FALSIFY
INFORMATION IN NEW ACCOUNT APPLICATIONS, LOAS AND OTHER
RECORDS.

AND THE LOAN TRANSACTION THAT WERE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO
MAKE THE STATEMENTS MADE, IN LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER
WHICH THEY WERE MADE, NOT MISLEADING. THE FIRM FAILED TO
DISCLOSE OR INADEQUATELY DISCLOSED THAT: THE SECURITY WAS
HARD-TO-BORROW DUE TO SHORT SELLING AND WAS FREQUENTLY
BORROWED TO FACILITATE SHORT SELLING; THE INTEREST RATES COULD
BE REDUCED BY THE FIRM; BROKERS RECEIVED COMMISSIONS FOR THE
DURATION OF THE LOAN; WHILE SECURITIES WERE ON LOAN, DIVIDENDS
WERE PAID AS A "CASH-IN-LIEU" AND THEREFORE SUBJECT TO HIGHER
TAX RATES; AND SHARES ON LOAN COULD BE SOLD AT ANY TIME. THE
FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SYSTEM, INCLUDING
WRITTEN PROCEDURES, TO SUPERVISE THE ACTIVITIES OF EACH
REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, REGISTERED PRINCIPAL, AND OTHER
ASSOCIATED PERSON RELATED TO THE PROGRAM THAT WAS
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

FAIR AND BALANCED, DID NOT PROVIDE A SOUND BASIS FOR EVALUATING
THE FACTS IN REGARD TO THE PROGRAM, AND OMITTED MATERIAL
FACTS THAT, IN LIGHT OF THE CONTEXT OF THE MATERIAL PRESENTED,
CAUSED THE COMMUNICATION TO BE MISLEADING. IN ADDITION, THE

Allegations:

NASD RULES 2110, 3010 - CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. WAS A LEAD
UNDERWRITER FOR AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) OF SHARES OF A
COMMON STOCK; AS PART OF THE OFFERING, SOME OF THE STOCK WAS
RESERVED BY THE ISSUER FOR SALE IN A DIRECTED SHARE PROGRAM
(DSP). TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DSP, CUSTOMERS WERE REQUIRED TO
OPEN A LIMITED-PURPOSE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT AT AN UNDERWRITER.
THE ISSUER AND THE UNDERWRITERS ADMINISTERED THE DSP THROUGH
AN ON-LINE ELECTRONIC PLATFORM MAINTAINED BY A THIRD PARTY
COMPANY. COMMUNICATIONS TO THE DSP PARTICIPANTS WERE TO BE
CONDUCTED THROUGH THE WEBSITE ADMINISTERED BY THE THIRD
PARTY COMPANY. THE FIRM HAD WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
FOR DSPS AND WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES FOR
OUTSOURCING BUT DID NOT FOLLOW THEM IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
DSP. THE WEBSITE SENT AN EMAIL TO THE DSP PARTICIPANTS THAT THE
IPO PRICE HAD BEEN DETERMINED, ALLOCATIONS HAD BEEN MADE AND
USERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS.
BECAUSE OF AN ERROR BY THE THIRD PARTY COMPANY IN DISABLING A
SERVER, PARTICIPANTS SAW MESSAGES STATING THEY HAD NOT BEEN
ALLOCATED SHARES. THE FIRM WAS NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEM UNTIL
IT CALLED CUSTOMERS REGARDING NON-PAYMENT FOR THEIR SHARES.
THE FIRM DID NOT TAKE SUFFICIENT ACTION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE
AND EXTENT OF THE DISSEMINATION OF INCORRECT INFORMATION
THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR IF ITS CUSTOMERS WERE HARMED BY
RELYING ON THE INCORRECT INFORMATION. THE FIRM DID NOT LEARN OF
THE CAUSE OF THE INCORRECT INFORMATION UNTIL AFTER THE THIRD
PARTY'S INVESTIGATION MONTHS LATER. THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH
OR IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES OR SYSTEMS
REGARDING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE THIRD PARTY COMPANY IN
COMMUNICATING WITH ITS CUSTOMERS; FAILED TO RESPOND
ADEQUATELY WHEN IT BECAME AWARE THAT INCORRECT INFORMATION
ABOUT IPO ALLOCATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS;
AND FAILED TO ENSURE THAT FINRA HAD THE SAME ACCESS TO THE
COMPANY'S WORK FOR THE FIRM IF IT HAD PERFORMED THE WORK
DIRECTLY BECAUSE THE COMPANY REQUIRED A CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT UNACCEPTABLE TO FINRA. THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH
AND MAINTAIN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES OR SYSTEMS REGARDING
THE OUTSOURCING OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH NASD RULES.

ON JULY 8, 2009, THE SECURITIES DIVISION ENTERED INTO A CONSENT
ORDER WITH CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. ("CITIGROUP") TO
SETTLE ALLEGATIONS THAT CITIGROUP MISLED INVESTORS AND FAILED
TO SUPERVISE ITS SALESPERSONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF
AUCTION RATE SECURITIES ("ARS"). ALTHOUGH MARKETED AND SOLD TO
INVESTORS AS SAFE, LIQUID, AND CASH-LIKE INVESTMENTS, ARS ARE
ACTUALLY LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS SUBJECT TO A COMPLEX AUCTION
PROCESS. THE AUCTION PROCESS FAILED IN EARLY 2008, LEADING TO
ILLIQUIDITY AND OFTEN TO LOWER INTEREST RATES FOR INVESTORS.
THE SECURITIES DIVISION ALLEGED THAT CITIGROUP ENGAGED IN
DISHONEST AND UNETHICAL PRACTICES BY FAILING TO ADEQUATELY
INFORM CUSTOMERS OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ARS. THE
SECURITIES DIVISION FURTHER ALLEGED THAT CITIGROUP FAILED TO
ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE ITS SALESPERSONS BY FAILING TO TRAIN THEM
ON THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ARS. THE CONSENT ORDER REQUIRES
CITIGROUP TO COMPLETE ITS REPURCHASE OF ARS FROM WASHINGTON
CUSTOMERS. THE ORDER ALSO REQUIRES CITIGROUP TO PAY A
$1,019,965.66 FINE TO THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. THE FINE
REPRESENTS WASHINGTON'S PRO-RATA SHARE OF A $50 MILLION
SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATED BY A MULTISTATE TASK FORCE OF STATE
REGULATORS FORMED BY THE NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES
ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION (NASAA). CITIGROUP WAIVED ITS RIGHT
TO A HEARING AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE MATTER.

REVENUE SHARING PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO STANDARD SALES LOADS
AND 12B-1 TRAIL PAYMENTS, CGMI
RECEIVED REVENUE SHARING PAYMENTS FROM INVESTMENT ADVISERS
AND DISTRIBUTORS ASSOCIATED WITH
APPROXIMATELY 75 MUTUAL FUND COMPLEXES. IN EXCHANGE FOR
THESE PAYMENTS, CGMI PROVIDED
"SHELF SPACE" TO MUTUAL FUNDS BY GRANTING THEM ACCESS TO, OR
INCREASED VISIBILITY IN, CGMI'S
EXTENSIVE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. THE SECOND DISCLOSURE
FAILURE RELATES TO CGMI'S SALES OF
CLASS B SHARES OF MUTUAL FUNDS IN AMOUNTS AGGREGATING $50,000
OR GREATER. CGMI DID NOT
ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE AT THE POINT OF SALE, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS

INCREASED VISIBILITY IN, CGMI'S
EXTENSIVE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. THE SECOND DISCLOSURE
FAILURE RELATES TO CGMI'S SALES OF
CLASS B SHARES OF MUTUAL FUNDS IN AMOUNTS AGGREGATING $50,000
OR GREATER. CGMI DID NOT
ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE AT THE POINT OF SALE, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS
RECOMMENDATIONS TO CUSTOMERS TO
PURCHASE CLASS B SHARES, THAT SUCH SHARES WERE SUBJECT TO
HIGHER ANNUAL FEES AND THAT THOSE FEES
COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE CUSTOMERS' INVESTMENT
RETURNS DEPENDING UPON THE INVESTMENT
AMOUNT AND THE INTENDED HOLDING PERIOD.CGMI'S REVENUE
SHARING PROGRAM, KNOWN AS THE TIER PROGRAM, CREATED AN
UNDISCLOSED CONFLICT OF INTEREST BECAUSE CGMI OFFERED AND
SOLD TO ITS CUSTOMERS ONLY THE SHARES OF
THOSE MUTUAL FUND COMPLEXES THAT PAID CGMI ADDITIONAL
COMPENSATION. WHEN CGMI
RECOMMENDED AND SOLD MUTUAL FUNDS TO ITS CUSTOMERS, CGMI
RELIED UPON THE DISCLOSURES THAT FUND
COMPANIES MADE IN THEIR PROSPECTUSES AND STATEMENTS OF
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ("SAIS"), ALTHOUGH MOST OF THOSE
DISCLOSURES DID NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FACTS THAT WOULD
ENABLE CGMI'S CUSTOMERS TO
UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF CGMI'S REVENUE SHARING
PROGRAM.

Allegations:

THE SEC ORDER FINDS THAT THERE WERE TWO DISTINCT DISCLOSURE
FAILURES BY CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. ("CGMI") IN THE OFFER
AND SALE OF MUTUAL FUND SHARES TO ITS CUTOMERS. THE FIRST
FAILURE RELATED TO CGMI'S REVENUE SHARING PROGRAM, WHEREBY
CGMI RECEIVED FROM ADVISERS AND DISTRIBUTORS ASSOCIATED WITH
ABOUT 75 MUTUAL FUND COMPLEXES REVENUE SHARING PAYMENTS, IN
EXCHANGE FOR WHICH CGMI GRANTED MUTUAL FUNDS ACCESS TO, OR
INCREASED VISIBILITY IN, CGMI'S RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. CGMI
DID NOT ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE ITS REVENUE SHARING PROGRAM TO
ITS CUSTOMERS BUT INSTEAD RELIED ON THE PARTICIPATING FUNDS'
PROSPECTUSES AND SAIS TO SATISFY ITS DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS
WITH REGARD TO ITS REVENUE SHARING PROGRAM. AS A RESULT, THE
ORDER FINDS THAT CGMI WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECURITIES ACT SECT.
17(A)(2) AND EXCHANGE ACT RULE 10B-10. THE SECOND DISCLOSURE
FAILURE CONCERNED CGMI'S SALES OF CLASS B SHARES OF MUTUAL
FUNDS IN AMOUNTS AGGREGATING $50,000 OR MORE, AND ITS FAILURE
TO DISCLOSE ADEQUATELY AT THE POINT OF SALE, IN CONNECTION WITH
RECOMMENDATIONS TO CUSTOMERS TO BUY CLASS B SHARES, THAT
SUCH SHARES WERE SUBJECT TO HIGHER ANNUAL FEES AND THAT
THOSE FEES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE CUSTOMERS'
INVESTMENT RETURNS DEPENDING ON AMOUNT INVESTED AND THE
INTENDED HOLDING PERIOD. AS A RESULT, THE ORDER FINDS THAT CGMI
WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECURITIES ACT SECT. 17(A)(2).

NASD CONDUCT RULES 2110, 2810, 2310, 3010, 3110 AND 2210(D)(1)(A) –
DURING THE PERIOD JANUARY 2002 TO NOVEMBER 2003 ("RELEVANT
PERIOD") CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. ("CGMI") MARKETED AND
SOLD TWO PROPRIETY MANAGED FUTURES PRODUCTS ("FUTURES
FUNDS") TO OVER 8,200 INVESTORS, RAISING APPROXIMATELY $199
MILLION. EACH FUTURES FUND INVESTED IN COMMODITIES, INCLUDING
FUTURES, OPTIONS ON FUTURES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. THIS
PRODUCT IS A SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT THAT CARRIES A HIGH DEGREE
OF RISK. DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, CGMI SOLD THE FUTURES
FUNDS TO 45 CUSTOMERS FOR WHOM THE INVESTMENT WAS
UNSUITABLE BASED ON THE MINIMUM NET WORTH AND INCOME
REQUIREMENTS. THESE 45 CUSTOMERS INVESTED A TOTAL OF $203,000
IN FUTURES FUNDS. IN EACH INSTANCE, THE CUSTOMER MADE AN
INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURES FUND RANGING FROM $2,000 TO $20,000
AND FAILED TO MEET MINIMUM NET WORTH AND INCOME
REQUIREMENTS. CGMI ALSO FAILED TO MAINTAIN RECORDS DISCLOSING
THE BASIS UPON WHICH ITS SUITABILITY DETERMINATIONS WERE MADE
IN ITS RECOMMENDATIONS AND SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN FUTURES
FUNDS. IN ADDITION, CMGI'S SUPERVISORY SYSTEM AND WRITTEN
PROCEDURES WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOR THE
MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS DISCLOSING THE BASIS OF THOSE
SUITABILITY DETERMINATIONS AS REQUIRED BY NASD RULES.
MOREOVER, THE FIRM INCLUDED ADVERTISEMENTS ON ITS WEBSITE

MEMBER CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS, INC., BETWEEN JULY 1, 2002 AND
JUNE 30, 2003, MADE AVAILABLE TO ITS CUSTOMERS FACT CARDS, SALES
PRESENTATIONS, SALES DECKS AND PROSPECTING LETTERS
REGARDING HEDGE FUNDS AND FUNDS OF HEDGE FUNDS ("FUNDS")
THAT DID NOT COMPLY WITH NASD RULES. THE SALES LITERATURE WAS
MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM'S CLIENTS WHO WERE EXISTING
SUBSCRIBERS TO THESE FUNDS AND ALSO TO QUALIFIED PROSPECTIVE
SUBSCRIBERS. EACH OF THESE PIECES OF SALES LITERATURE LISTED A
TARGETED RATE OF RETURN WITHOUT PROVIDING A SOUND BASIS FOR
EVALUATING THE TARGET, IMPROPERLY USED HYPOTHETICAL RETURNS
IN CHARTS OR GRAPHS, AND/OR FAILED TO INCLUDE ADEQUATE RISK
DISCLOSURE. SALES PRESENTATIONS FOR RECENTLY STARTED FUNDS
OF HEDGE FUNDS PRESENTED HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE THAT
PREDATED THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR OPERATIONS. THESE
HYPOTHETICAL RESULTS DID NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE
OF THE FUNDS OF HEDGE FUNDS. INSTEAD, THESE HYPOTHETICAL
RESULTS WERE CALCULATED BY SELECTING A PORTFOLIO OF INDIVIDUAL
ADVISORS WITH WHOM THE FUND OF HEDGE FUNDS INTENDED TO OR
RECENTLY HAD BEGUN TO INVEST, AND BY COMBINING THE HISTORIC
PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF THESE SELECTED ADVISORS, USING A
HYPOTHETICAL ALLOCATION OF ASSETS. THESE PRESENTATIONS
CREATED THE MISIMPRESSION THAT THE PARTICULAR FUND OF HEDGE
FUNDS HAD A LONGER TRACK RECORD THAN IT ACTUALLY POSSESSED.

INC. EXECUTED THE SIMULTANEOUS SALE AND PURCHASE OF
CORPORATE BONDS BY INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AT THE SAME FACE

THE FIRM'S MARKUP OR MARKDOWN TO ITS CUSTOMERS EXCEEDED THE
LEVEL OF COMPENSATION PERMITTED BY NASD RULE 2440 AND THE
NASD MARKUP POLICY AND COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED BY THE FIRM. IN
THREE PAIRS OF TRADES EXECUTED ON THE FIRM'S DISTRESSED
LEVELS, THE FIRM RECEIVED MARKUPS BETWEEN 15.9-32.29% ALTHOUGH
REASONABLENESS UNDER IM-2440(B) GENERALLY SHOULD NOT EXCEED
5%. THE FIRM FAILED TO CREATE RECORDS OF ORDERS AND
INSTRUCTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS IN HIGH YIELD AND DISTRESSED
BONDS, AND DID NOT REQUIRE TRADERS TO RECORD ACTUAL TRADE
EXECUTION TIMES. THE FIRM'S ELECTRONIC TRADE ENTRY SYSTEM
AUTOMATICALLY REPORTED TRANSACTIONS TO FIPS ON BEHALF OF THE
FIRM WHEN THE TRANSACTION WAS ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM, NOT
THE ACTUAL TIME OF EXECUTION OF THE TRANSACTION, RESULTING IN
THE FIRM CONSISTENTLY REPORTING TO FIPS THE INCORRECT TIME OF
EXEUCTION FOR TRANSACTIONS IN FIPS SECURITIES AND HIGH YIELD
SECURITIES; THE FIRM INCORRECTLY REPORTED TO FIPS TRANSACTIONS
IN FIPS SECURITIES AND HIGH YIELD SECURITIES THAT SHOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO FIPS. THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY SYSTEM FOR
HIGH YIELD AND DISTRESSED BOND TRADING WAS LACKING AS TO
SURVEILLANCE AND GUIDANCE REGARDING APPLICATION OF THE NASD
MARKUP POLICY, DID NOT PROVIDE FOR A REVIEW OF TRADES TO
DETERMINE IF IT COMPLIED WITH THE NASD MARKUP POLICY, DID NOT
SPECIFY WHAT ACTION TO TAKE IF A MARKUP/MARKDOWN VIOLATED THE
NASD MARKUP POLICY, THE FIRM RELIED ON AN INTERNAL SYSTEM TO
AUTOMATE FIPS REPORTING THAT DID NOT ACCURATELY REPORT FIPS
TRADES AND THE FIRM HAD NO PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MONITOR THE
ACCURACY OF THE FIPS REPORTS.

BONDS. THAT TAX-EXEMPT STATUS WAS THE BONDS' ESSENTIAL
INVESTMENT FEATURE. IN SOME CASES, A BROKERAGE FIRM'S
OVERCHARGING DIVERTED MONEY FROM THE U.S. TREASURY TO THE
FIRM. IN THE REMAINING CASES, OVERCHARGING BY THE BROKERAGE
FIRM TOOK MONEY AWAY FROM THE MUNICIPALITY BY REDUCING,
DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, THE SAVINGS THAT THE MUNICIPALITY RECEIVED

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS BY SELLING SECURITIES TO MUNICIPALITIES

BURNING CLAIMS WITH A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN BROKERAGE FIRMS BY
THE SEC, NASD REGULATION, INC., THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF THE
TREASURY. THIS GLOBAL RESOLUTION REQUIRES THE FIRMS TO PAY A
TOTAL OF MORE THAN $139 MILLION. INCLUDING THE ACTIONS
ANNOUNCED TODAY, MORE THAN $172 MILLION WILL HAVE BEEN PAID BY
21 FIRMS TO RESOLVE CHARGES OF YIELD BURNING AND RELATED
CLAIMS. YIELD BURNING INVOLVES OVERCHARGES BY BROKERAGE
FIRMS ON TREASURY SECURITIES PURCHASED WITH PROCEEDS FROM
THE SALE OF MUNICIPAL BONDS. YIELD BURNING BY BROKERAGE FIRMS
JEOPARDIZED THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF INTEREST PAID TO HOLDERS
OF THOSE BONDS. WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS,
EACH FIRM INCLUDING SALOMON SMITH BARNEY INC.
CONSENTED TO A CENSURE, A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER PROHIBITING
FUTURE VIOLATIONS, AND AGREED TO DISGORGE THE ILL-GOTTEN GAINS
IT RECEIVED FROM THE OVERCHARGING. (RELS. 33-7829; 34-42634; FILE

SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 22134, OCTOBER 19, 2011: THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) CHARGED CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS
INC. (CITIGROUP), WITH MISLEADING INVESTORS ABOUT A $1 BILLION
COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION (CDO). AT A TIME WHEN THE U.S.
HOUSING MARKET WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF DISTRESS, CITIGROUP
STRUCTURED AND MARKETED THE CDO AND EXERCISED SIGNIFICANT
INFLUENCE OVER THE SELECTION OF $500 MILLION OF THE ASSETS
INCLUDED IN THE CDO. CITIGROUP THEN TOOK A PROPRIETARY SHORT
POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THOSE $500 MILLION OF ASSETS. THAT
SHORT POSITION WOULD PROVIDE PROFITS TO CITIGROUP IN THE EVENT
OF A DOWNTURN IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSING MARKET AND GAVE
CITIGROUP ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE CDO TRANSACTION THAT
WERE ADVERSE TO THE INTERESTS OF INVESTORS. CITIGROUP DID NOT
DISCLOSE TO INVESTORS THE ROLE THAT IT PLAYED IN THE ASSET
SELECTION PROCESS OR THE SHORT POSITION THAT IT TOOK WITH
RESPECT TO THE ASSETS THAT IT HELPED SELECT. WITHOUT ADMITTING
OR DENYING THE SEC'S ALLEGATIONS, CITIGROUP CONSENTED TO
SETTLE THE COMMISSION'S ACTION.
THE SEC ALSO BROUGHT A LITIGATED CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A FORMER
CITIGROUP EMPLOYEE AND INSTITUTED SETTLED ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST TWO INVESTMENT ADVISER (IA) FIRMS, AND
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL, BASED ON THEIR CONDUCT IN THE CDO
TRANSACTION.

ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINTS, FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT
COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (SDNY), IN OR
AROUND OCTOBER 2006, PERSONNEL FROM CITIGROUP'S CDO TRADING
AND STRUCTURING DESKS HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT POSSIBLY HAVING
THE TRADING DESK ESTABLISH A SHORT POSITION IN A SPECIFIC GROUP
OF ASSETS BY USING CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS (CDS) TO BUY
PROTECTION ON THOSE ASSETS FROM A CDO THAT CITIGROUP WOULD
STRUCTURE AND MARKET. FOLLOWING THE INSTITUTION OF
DISCUSSIONS WITH ONE OF THE IA FIRMS ABOUT HAVING IT ACT AS THE
COLLATERAL MANAGER FOR A PROPOSED CDO TRANSACTION, THE
FORMER EMPLOYEE SENT AN E-MAIL TO HIS SUPERVISOR IN WHICH HE
STATED THAT HE HOPED THAT THE TRANSACTION WOULD GO FORWARD

PROTECTION ON THOSE ASSETS FROM A CDO THAT CITIGROUP WOULD

FORMER EMPLOYEE SENT AN E-MAIL TO HIS SUPERVISOR IN WHICH HE
STATED THAT HE HOPED THAT THE TRANSACTION WOULD GO FORWARD
AND DESCRIBED THE TRANSACTION AS THE CITIGROUP TRADING DESK
HEAD'S "PROP TRADE (DON'T TELL THE IA FIRM). THE IA FIRM AGREED TO
TERMS EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T GET TO PICK THE ASSETS."

User Guidance

AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINTS, CITIGROUP AND THE IA
FIRM AGREED TO PROCEED WITH THE CDO TRANSACTION. DURING THE
TIME WHEN THE TRANSACTION WAS BEING STRUCTURED, THE IA FIRM
ALLOWED CITIGROUP TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE
SELECTION OF ASSETS INCLUDED IN THE CDO PORTFOLIO. THE CDO
TRANSACTION MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH A PITCH BOOK AND AN
OFFERING CIRCULAR. THE FORMER EMPLOYEE WAS PRIMARILY
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE DOCUMENTS. BOTH THE PITCH BOOK AND THE
OFFERING CIRCULAR INCLUDED DISCLOSURES THAT THE IA FIRM, THE
COLLATERAL MANAGER, HAD SELECTED THE COLLATERAL FOR THE CDO
PORTFOLIO AND THAT CITIGROUP WOULD ACT AS THE INITIAL CDS
COUNTERPARTY. THE DISCLOSURES, HOWEVER, DID NOT PROVIDE ANY
INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENT OF CITIGROUP'S INTEREST IN THE
NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE CDO COLLATERAL OR THAT, BY THE
TIMES WHEN THE PITCH BOOK AND THE OFFERING CIRCULAR WERE
PREPARED, CITIGROUP ALREADY HAD SHORT POSITIONS IN $500 MILLION
OF THE COLLATERAL. THE PITCH BOOK AND THE OFFERING CIRCULAR
WERE MATERIALLY MISLEADING BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO DISCLOSE
THAT CITIGROUP HAD PLAYED A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN SELECTING THE
ASSETS FOR THE CDO, CITIGROUP HAD TAKEN A $500 MILLION SHORT
POSITION IN THE CDO COLLATERAL FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT, AND
CITIGROUP'S SHORT POSITION WAS COMPRISED OF NAMES IT HAD BEEN
ALLOWED TO SELECT, WHILE CITIGROUP DID NOT SHORT NAMES THAT IT
HAD NO ROLE IN SELECTING. NOTHING IN THE DISCLOSURES PUT
INVESTORS ON NOTICE CITIGROUP HAD INTERESTS THAT WERE
ADVERSE TO THE INTERESTS OF INVESTORS. (CONTINUED IN

ON AUGUST 5, 2014 A FINAL JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED WHEREIN THE

Regulator Statement

(CONTINUED FROM #7) ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINTS, THE CDO
TRANSACTION CLOSED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2007. ONE EXPERIENCED CDO
TRADER CHARACTERIZED THE CDO PORTFOLIO AS "DOGSH!T" AND
"POSSIBLY THE BEST SHORT EVER!" AND AN EXPERIENCED COLLATERAL
MANAGER COMMENTED THAT "THE PORTFOLIO IS HORRIBLE." ON
NOVEMBER 7, 2007, A CREDIT RATING AGENCY DOWNGRADED EVERY
TRANCHE OF THE CDO, AND ON NOVEMBER 19, 2007, THE CDO WAS
DECLARED TO BE IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. THE APPROXIMATELY 15
INVESTORS IN THE CDO TRANSACTION LOST THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENTS
IN CDO. CITIGROUP RECEIVED FEES OF APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION FOR
STRUCTURING AND MARKETING THE TRANSACTION AND REALIZED NET
PROFITS OF AT LEAST $160 MILLION FROM ITS SHORT POSITION ON $500
MILLION OF THE COLLATERAL.

AS A RESULT OF THEIR CONDUCT, THE COMMISSION HAS ALLEGED THAT
CITIGROUP AND THE FORMER EMPLOYEE EACH VIOLATED SECTIONS
17(A)(2) AND (3) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. WITHOUT ADMITTING
OR DENYING THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMMISSION'S COMPLAINT,

WAS ACTING IN THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF AN ARRANGING BANK, WHEN
IN FACT CITI HAD ALLEGEDLY EXERCISED INFLUENCE OVER THE

SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 21585, JUNE 30, 2010: THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THAT CITIGROUP GLOBAL
MARKETS THAT SETTLED THE COMMISSION'S AUCTION RATE SECURITIES
(ARS) CHARGES AGAINST IT HAS SATISFIED ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE
SETTLEMENT. CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS, INC.WAS REQUIRED TO
OFFER TO PURCHASE ARS AT PAR FROM INDIVIDUAL, CHARITABLE, AND
SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. NEARLY 100% OF THESE CUSTOMERS
HAVE ACCEPTED THE OFFER. CITIGROUP PURCHASED ARS FROM ITS
ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS IN THE AMOUNT OF $6.38 BILLION. THE
SETTLEMENT ALSO REQUIRED CITIGROUP TO USE "BEST EFFORTS" TO
PROVIDE LIQUIDITY OPPORTUNITIES TO INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS. TO
ASSIST IN ITS ANALYSIS OF WHETHER THE FIRM HAD IN FACT USED "BEST
EFFORTS," THE SEC RETAINED AN OUTSIDE EXPERT WITH EXTENSIVE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARS MARKET. FROM THE TIME OF THE ARS MARKET
FAILURE IN FEBRUARY 2008 THROUGH MAY 31, 2010, CITIGROUP
INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMER HOLDINGS WERE REDUCED BY $8.46 BILLION
OR 46% (FROM $18.55 BILLION TO $10.09 BILLION). IN COMPLIANCE WITH
ITS OBLIGATIONS, CITIGROUP IMPLEMENTED BROAD-BASED LIQUIDITY
MEASURES FOR ITS INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. CITIGROUP ALSO MET
ITS OTHER SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING COMPENSATING
INVESTORS WHO SOLD ARS BELOW PAR, REIMBURSING INVESTORS FOR
EXCESS INTEREST COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS TAKEN OUT DUE TO
ARS ILLIQUIDITY, AND PARTICIPATING IN SPECIAL ARBITRATION
PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY
AUTHORITY. THE FIRM ALSO SUBMITTED PERIODIC REPORTS TO, AND MET

SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 20824, DECEMBER 11, 2008: SECTION 15(C) OF
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 -THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION FINALIZED SETTLEMENT WITH CITIGROUP
GLOBAL MARKETS, INC. (CITI), THAT WILL PROVIDE NEARLY $7 BILLION TO
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS WHO INVESTED IN AUCTION RATE
SECURITIES BEFORE THE MARKET FOR THOSE SECURITIES FROZE IN
FEBRUARY. THE SETTLEMENT RESOLVES THE SEC'S CHARGES THAT THE
FIRMS MISLED INVESTORS REGARDING THE LIQUIDITY RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ARS) THAT IT
UNDERWROTE, MARKETED AND SOLD. PREVIOUSLY, ON AUGUST 7 AND 8,
2008, THE COMMISSION'S DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT ANNOUNCED A
PRELIMINARY SETTLEMENT WITH CITI. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S
COMPLAINT, FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK CITY, CITI
MISREPRESENTED TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARS WERE SAFE, HIGHLY LIQUID
INVESTMENTS THAT WERE COMPARABLE TO MONEY MARKETS.
ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINT, IN LATE 2007 AND EARLY 2008, THE FIRM
KNEW THAT THE ARS MARKET WAS DETERIORATING, CAUSING THE FIRM
TO HAVE TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL INVENTORY TO PREVENT FAILED
AUCTIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE FIRM KNEW THAT ITS
ABILITY TO SUPPORT AUCTIONS BY PURCHASING MORE ARS HAD BEEN
REDUCED, AS THE CREDIT CRISIS STRESSED THE FIRM'S BALANCE
SHEET. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT CITI FAILED TO MAKE ITS
CUSTOMERS AWARE OF THESE RISKS. IN MID-FEBRUARY 2008,
ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINT, CITI DECIDED TO STOP SUPPORTING
THE ARS MARKET, LEAVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CITI CUSTOMERS
HOLDING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ILLIQUID ARS. THE
SETTLEMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL, WILL RESTORE
APPROXIMATELY $7 BILLION IN LIQUIDITY TO CITI CUSTOMERS WHO
INVESTED IN ARS.
