What is included in a BrokerCheck report?
BrokerCheck reports for individual brokers include information such as employment history, professional
qualifications, disciplinary actions, criminal convictions, civil judgments and arbitration awards. BrokerCheck
reports for brokerage firms include information on a firm’s profile, history, and operations, as well as many of the
same disclosure events mentioned above.
Please note that the information contained in a BrokerCheck report may include pending actions or
allegations that may be contested, unresolved or unproven. In the end, these actions or allegations may be
resolved in favor of the broker or brokerage firm, or concluded through a negotiated settlement with no
admission or finding of wrongdoing.
Where did this information come from?
The information contained in BrokerCheck comes from FINRA’s Central Registration Depository, or
CRD® and is a combination of:
o information FINRA and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) require brokers and
brokerage firms to submit as part of the registration and licensing process, and
o information that regulators report regarding disciplinary actions or allegations against firms or brokers.
How current is this information?
Generally, active brokerage firms and brokers are required to update their professional and disciplinary
information in CRD within 30 days. Under most circumstances, information reported by brokerage firms, brokers
and regulators is available in BrokerCheck the next business day.
What if I want to check the background of an investment adviser firm or investment adviser
representative?
To check the background of an investment adviser firm or representative, you can search for the firm or
individual in BrokerCheck. If your search is successful, click on the link provided to view the available licensing
and registration information in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website at
https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. In the alternative, you may search the IAPD website directly or contact your
state securities regulator at http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/P455414.
Are there other resources I can use to check the background of investment professionals?
FINRA recommends that you learn as much as possible about an investment professional before
deciding to work with them. Your state securities regulator can help you research brokers and investment adviser
representatives doing business in your state.

Disclosure Event Details
What you should know about reported disclosure events:
1. BrokerCheck provides details for any disclosure event that was reported in CRD. It also includes
summary information regarding FINRA arbitration awards in cases where the brokerage firm was
named as a respondent.
2. Certain thresholds must be met before an event is reported to CRD, for example:
o A law enforcement agency must file formal charges before a brokerage firm is required to disclose a
particular criminal event.
3. Disclosure events in BrokerCheck reports come from different sources:
o Disclosure events for this brokerage firm were reported by the firm and/or regulators. When the firm
and a regulator report information for the same event, both versions of the event will appear in the
BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source
labeled.
4. There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:
o A disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, or final.
§ A "pending" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated.
§ An event that is "on appeal" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently
being appealed.
§ A "final" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.
o A final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled or otherwise resolved.
§ An "adjudicated" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter,
or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party
charged with some alleged wrongdoing.
§ A "settled" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter.
Please note that firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for
business or other reasons.
§ A "resolved" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of
wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker. Such matters generally involve customer
disputes.
5. You may wish to contact the brokerage firm to obtain further information regarding any of the
disclosure events contained in this BrokerCheck report.

Regulatory - Final
This type of disclosure event involves (1) a final, formal proceeding initiated by a regulatory authority (e.g., a state
securities agency, self-regulatory organization, federal regulator such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
foreign financial regulatory body) for a violation of investment-related rules or regulations; or (2) a revocation or
suspension of the authority of a brokerage firm or its control affiliate to act as an attorney, accountant or federal
contractor.

SEC ADMIN RELEASES 33-10355, 34-80639, IA RELEASE 40-4705/ MAY 10,
2017: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("COMMISSION")
DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED
AGAINST BARCLAYS CAPITAL INC. ("BARCLAYS CAPITAL" OR
"RESPONDENT"). ON THE BASIS OF THIS ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S
OFFER, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT FROM SEPTEMBER 2010 THROUGH
DECEMBER 2015, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, THEN A DUALLY REGISTERED
INVESTMENT ADVISER AND BROKER-DEALER, IMPROPERLY CHARGED
CERTAIN ADVISORY CLIENTS OF ITS WEALTH AND INVESTMENT
MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, OVERCHARGING THEM ALMOST $50 MILLION IN
ADVISORY FEES. FIRST, FROM SEPTEMBER 2010 THROUGH DECEMBER
2014, BARCLAYS CAPITAL FALSELY REPRESENTED TO ADVISORY CLIENTS
THAT IT WAS PERFORMING ONGOING DUE DILIGENCE AND MONITORING
OF CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS WHO MANAGED ADVISORY
CLIENTS' ASSETS USING CERTAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES WHEN
BARCLAYS CAPITAL WAS NOT PERFORMING SUCH DUE DILIGENCE. AS A
RESULT, BARCLAYS CAPITAL IMPROPERLY CHARGED 2,050 CLIENT
ACCOUNTS APPROXIMATELY $48 MILLION IN FEES FOR THESE PROMISED
SERVICES. SECOND, FROM JANUARY 2011 THROUGH MARCH 2015,
BARCLAYS CAPITAL CHARGED 22,138 CLIENT ACCOUNTS EXCESS FEES
OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, FROM AT LEAST JANUARY
2010 THROUGH DECEMBER 2015, BARCLAYS CAPITAL DISADVANTAGED
CERTAIN RETIREMENT PLAN AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION
BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS ("ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS") BY RECOMMENDING
AND SELLING THEM MORE EXPENSIVE MUTUAL FUND SHARE CLASSES
WHEN LESS EXPENSIVE SHARE CLASSES WERE AVAILABLE, WITHOUT
DISCLOSING THAT BARCLAYS CAPITAL HAD A MATERIAL CONFLICT OF
INTEREST, I.E., THAT IT WOULD RECEIVE GREATER COMPENSATION FROM
THE ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS' PURCHASES OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE
SHARE CLASSES. IN ADDITION, BARCLAYS CAPITAL DID NOT DISCLOSE
THAT THE PURCHASE OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE SHARE CLASSES WOULD
NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE OVERALL RETURN ON THE ELIGIBLE
CUSTOMERS' INVESTMENTS, IN LIGHT OF THE DIFFERENT FEE
STRUCTURES FOR THE DIFFERENT FUND SHARE CLASSES. BARCLAYS
CAPITAL SOLD ITS WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, AMERICAS
BUSINESS ("WIMA," FORMERLY KNOWN AS BARCLAYS WEALTH AMERICAS)
IN DECEMBER 2015. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT, BARCLAYS CAPITAL
WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 206(2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT, SECTION

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
COMPLY WITH RULE 15C3-5 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.
THE FIRM'S CONTROLS WERE INADEQUATE IN THAT: (A) A SOFT BLOCK
PRICE CONTROL IN THE ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM COULD BE
INADVERTENTLY OVERRIDDEN WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS; AND
(B) THE FIRM LACKED PRICE CONTROLS WITHIN A SMART ORDER ROUTER
TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF AN ERRONEOUS ORDER. ON MAY 22, 2014, A
FIRM TRADER ENTERED AN ORDER INTO THE FIRM'S ORDER
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AFTER THE CLOSE AT 16:01:27 TO SELL SHORT 111
SHARES OF A SECURITY WITH A LIMIT OF $15.27, EVEN THOUGH THE
SECURITY HAD CLOSED AT $31.23. THE TRADER RECEIVED A POP-UP
ALERT INFORMING THE TRADER THAT THE PRICE WAS 5% BELOW THE
LAST SALE, BUT HE INADVERTENTLY OVERRODE IT. THE ORDER
RESULTED IN AN EXECUTION OF 100 SHARES AT $29.76 AND 11 SHARES AT
$15.27 (51% BELOW THE LAST SALE). ON DECEMBER 8, 2015, A FIRM

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT THE FIRM'S
RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
COMPLY WITH RULE 15C3-5 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.
THE FIRM'S CONTROLS WERE INADEQUATE IN THAT: (A) A SOFT BLOCK
PRICE CONTROL IN THE ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM COULD BE
INADVERTENTLY OVERRIDDEN WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS; AND
(B) THE FIRM LACKED PRICE CONTROLS WITHIN A SMART ORDER ROUTER
TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF AN ERRONEOUS ORDER. ON MARCH 22, 2014,
A FIRM TRADER ENTERED AN ORDER INTO THE FIRM'S ORDER
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AFTER THE CLOSE AT 16:01:27 TO SELL SHORT 111
SHARES OF A SECURITY WITH A LIMIT OF $15.27, EVEN THOUGH THE
SECURITY HAD CLOSED AT $31.23. THE TRADER RECEIVED A POP-UP
ALERT INFORMING THE TRADER THAT THE PRICE WAS 5% BELOW THE
LAST SALE, BUT HE INADVERTENTLY OVERRODE IT. THE ORDER
RESULTED IN AN EXECUTION OF 100 SHARES AT $29.76 AND 11 SHARES AT
$15.27 (51% BELOW THE LAST SALE). ON DECEMBER 8, 2015, A FIRM
REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE ENTERED A CLIENT ORDER IN ANOTHER
SECURITY INTO THE FIRM'S ALGORITHMIC TRADING PLATFORM BEFORE
THE MARKET OPEN. THE TRADING PLATFORM'S SMART ORDER ROUTER
THEN ROUTED THE ORDER TO NASDAQ USING A PEGGING LOGIC TO
ENTER AN ORDER TO SELL 300 SHARES OF THE SECURITY AT 9:30:00.495
AT THE MIDPOINT, BASED ON NASDAQ'S PUBLISHED NATIONAL BEST BID
OR OFFER (NBBO) OF $8.67 X $90.00, WITH A LIMIT PRICE OF $0.0001 AS
COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS DAY'S CLOSE OF $86.69. AS A RESULT, THE
FIRM SOLD 100 SHARES OF THE SECURITY AT $84.69, 100 SHARES AT
$84.34, AND 100 SHARES AT $49.335 (43% BELOW THE PREVIOUS CLOSE).
THE $49.335 TRADE WAS CANCELLED BY NASDAQ. ALTHOUGH THE
TRADING PLATFORM HAD PRICE AND SIZE CONTROLS IN PLACE AT THE
TIME THE ORDER WAS ENTERED, THE ORDER WAS ROUTED WITH THE
SMART ORDER ROUTER USING THE PEGGED LOGIC AND THE ORDER
MANAGEMENT CONTROLS WERE BYPASSED. THE SMART ORDER ROUTER
DID NOT APPLY PRICE CONTROLS FOR ORDERS WITH PEGGED
INSTRUCTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM VIOLATED SEC RULE 15C3-5(B)
AND 15C3-5(C)(1)(II), AND NASDAQ RULES 3010 AND 2010A.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT SEVERAL
SYSTEMS ISSUES AT THE FIRM GAVE RISE TO APPROXIMATELY 3.6 BILLION
ORDER AUDIT TRAIL SYSTEM (OATS) REPORTING VIOLATIONS. THE
FINDINGS STATED THAT THE SYSTEMS ISSUES IMPACTED UP TO THREE
PERCENT OF ALL REPORTABLE ORDER EVENTS (ROES) THE FIRM WAS
REQUIRED TO TRANSMIT TO OATS. SPECIFICALLY, THE SYSTEMS ISSUES
CAUSED THE FIRM TO REPORT TO OATS APPROXIMATELY 3.3 BILLION
INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE ROES WHICH INCLUDED OMITTING
SPECIAL HANDLING CODES, INACCURATE TIMESTAMPS, INACCURATE
EXECUTION QUANTITIES, DUPLICATE OR ERRONEOUS REPORTS, AND
INACCURATE MEMBER TYPE CODES. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT
THE FIRM FAILED TO REPORT TO OATS APPROXIMATELY 332 MILLION
ROES WHICH INCLUDED CANCEL REPORTS, ROUTE REPORTS, DESK
REPORTS, AND EXECUTION REPORTS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM'S
TRANSMISSION OF INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE ROES AND ITS FAILURE
TO TRANSMIT ROES TO OATS CAUSED THE AUDIT TRAIL TO BE
INACCURATE. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM'S
SUPERVISORY SYSTEM DID NOT PROVIDE FOR SUPERVISION
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH RESPECT TO
THE APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE RULES
OF FINRA, CONCERNING OATS REPORTING. THE FIRM FAILED TO
ESTABLISH SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES THAT WERE REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM'S SUBMISSIONS TO OATS WERE
ACCURATE AND COMPLETE IN COMPARISON TO ITS TRADE RECORDS.

IN ADDITION, BARCLAYS VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND

BARCLAYS ALSO FAILED TO DISCLOSE ADEQUATELY ITS PRACTICE OF

MISREPRESENTED THE TYPE AND NUMBER OF MARKET DATA FEEDS THAT

NONETHELESS, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO PUBLISH THE INDEX FOR EIGHT

ERROR THAT WAS CAUSING THE INACCURACIES. THEREAFTER, THE FIRM

FIRM ALSO REPORTED THE INDEX INACCURACIES AND THE ASSOCIATED
RESTATEMENT TO A EUROPEAN REGULATOR AND DISCLOSED THEM IN A
FORM 4530(B) WITH FINRA. NEVERTHELESS, SUBSCRIBERS TO THE INDEX
HAD A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THE FIRM WOULD PROMPTLY
INFORM THEM OF SIGNIFICANT INACCURACIES. THEREFORE, ONCE THE
FIRM BECAME AWARE OF SIGNIFICANT INACCURACIES IN THE INDEX IT
HAD AN OBLIGATION TO INFORM SUBSCRIBERS PENDING CORRECTION
OF THE ERRORS. THE FIRM MARKETED THE INDEX AS OFFERING BROAD
PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS FOR SECURITIZATION MARKET INVESTORS
AND AS PROVIDING AN ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF THE CREDIT AND
PREPAYMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTMENT-GRADE EUROPEAN
ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES MARKET. THE INDEX, WHICH WAS AVAILABLE
TO SUBSCRIBERS OF THE FIRM'S PUBLISHED INDICES, WAS FOLLOWED
BY APPROXIMATELY 40 INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IN EUROPE. THE
FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO IMPLEMENT A
SUPERVISORY SYSTEM REASONABLY DESIGNED TO OVERSEE THE
PUBLICATION OF THE INDEX AND TO ENSURE DETECTION AND TIMELY
CORRECTION OF THE ERROR. AFTER THE FIRM MADE SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES TO THE METHODOLOGY BY WHICH THE INDEX RETURN WAS
CALCULATED AND CHANGED THE SOURCE OF THE COUPON RETURN
DATA FOR THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES, THE FIRM FAILED TO CONDUCT
ANY ADDITIONAL TESTING OR VERIFICATION OF THE OPERATION OF THE
METHODOLOGY AFTER IT WAS IMPLEMENTED. THE FINDINGS ALSO
INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM PUBLISHED MATERIALLY INACCURATE INDEX IN
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC. THE FIRM PUBLISHED THE INDEX
WHILE KNOWING OR HAVING REASON TO KNOW THAT IT CONTAINED
MATERIALLY INACCURATE INFORMATION.

CFTC RELEASE PR7180-15, MAY 20, 2015: THE COMMODITY FUTURES
TRADING COMMISSION HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT BARCLAYS PLC,
BARCLAYS BANK PLC, AND THE RESPONDENT FIRM BARCLAYS CAPITAL
INC. - (COLLECTIVELY, "RESPONDENTS," "BARCLAYS," OR THE "BANK") HAVE VIOLATED THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT (THE "ACT" OR "CEA")
AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS ("REGULATIONS"). THEREFORE, THE
COMMISSION DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE,
INSTITUTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER RESPONDENTS ENGAGED IN THE
VIOLATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN, AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY
ORDER SHALL BE ISSUED IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS. BEGINNING
AT LEAST AS EARLY AS JANUARY 2007 AND CONTINUING THROUGH JUNE
2012 (THE "RELEVANT PERIOD"), BARCLAYS, BY AND THROUGH CERTAIN
OF ITS TRADERS IN NEW YORK, AT TIMES ATTEMPTED TO MANIPULATE
THE U.S. DOLLAR INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION
FIX ("USD ISDAFIX" OR THE "BENCHMARK"), A LEADING GLOBAL
BENCHMARK REFERENCED IN A RANGE OF INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS,
TO BENEFIT THE BANK'S DERIVATIVES POSITIONS. DURING THE PERIOD,
USD ISDAFIX WAS SET EACH DAY IN A PROCESS THAT BEGAN AT 11:00 A.M.
EASTERN TIME WITH THE CAPTURE AND RECORDING OF SWAP RATES
AND SPREADS FROM A U.S. - BASED UNIT OF A LEADING INTEREST RATE

USD ISDAFIX WAS SET EACH DAY IN A PROCESS THAT BEGAN AT 11:00 A.M.
EASTERN TIME WITH THE CAPTURE AND RECORDING OF SWAP RATES
AND SPREADS FROM A U.S. - BASED UNIT OF A LEADING INTEREST RATE
SWAPS BROKING FIRM ("SWAPS BROKER"), SWAPS BROKER
DISSEMINATED RATES AND SPREADS CAPTURED IN THIS "SNAPSHOT" OR
"PRINT" - AS IT WAS REFERRED TO BY TRADERS AND BROKERS - AS
REFERENCES TO A PANEL OF BANKS. THE BANKS THEN MADE
SUBMISSIONS TO SWAPS BROKER. EACH BANK'S SUBMISSION WAS
SUPPOSED TO REFLECT THE MIDPOINT OF WHERE THAT DEALER WOULD
ITSELF OFFER AND BID A SWAP TO A DEALER OF GOOD CREDIT AS OF
11:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME. MOST BANKS ON THE PANEL, INCLUDING
BARCLAYS, USUALLY SUBMITTED SWAPS BROKER'S REFERENCE RATES
AND SPREADS AS CAPTURED IN THE SNAPSHOT. AS A RESULT, AFTER AN
AVERAGING OF THE SUBMISSIONS, THE REFERENCE RATES AND
SPREADS BECAME THE PUBLISHED USD ISDAFIX ALMOST EVERY DAY. A
BARCLAYS INTEREST RATE OPTIONS TRADER ("OPTIONS TRADER 1")
ONCE REFERRED IN AN EMAIL TO THE RISK THAT "SOMETIMES ISDAFIX IS
MANIPULATED," AND IN FACT, BARCLAYS, THROUGH OPTIONS TRADER 1
AND OTHERS AT THE BANK, ON MANY OCCASIONS DURING THE RELEVANT
PERIOD ATTEMPTED TO MANIPULATE USD ISDAFIX RATES THROUGH ITS
TRADING AT THE 11:00 A.M. FIXING AND BY MAKING SUBMISSIONS TO
SWAPS BROKER THAT WERE SKEWED TO BENEFIT DERIVATIVES
POSITIONS HELD BY BARCLAYS. BARCLAYS' UNLAWFUL CONDUCT
INVOLVED MULTIPLE TRADERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DESK HEADS DURING
THE RELEVANT PERIOD.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT TO WIN
INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS FROM A COMPANY, BARCLAYS' EQUITY
RESEARCH ANALYST PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRM'S SOLICITATION EFFORTS
OF THE COMPANY'S PLANNED INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO). THE
FINDINGS STATED THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS
INVITED BARCLAYS AND OTHER BROKER-DEALERS TO COMPETE FOR A
ROLE IN THE COMPANY'S IPO. BARCLAYS ALLOWED ITS RESEARCH
ANALYST TO PRESENT HIS VIEWS ON THE COMPANY TO ITS MANAGEMENT
AND PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS. BEFORE THE COMPANY AWARDED ITS IPO
BUSINESS, IT ASKED THE EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS FROM THE FIRMS
COMPETING FOR THE BUSINESS TO MAKE PRESENTATIONS TO THE
COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS. THE COMPANY

AND PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS. BEFORE THE COMPANY AWARDED ITS IPO
BUSINESS, IT ASKED THE EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS FROM THE FIRMS
COMPETING FOR THE BUSINESS TO MAKE PRESENTATIONS TO THE
COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS. THE COMPANY
PROVIDED SPECIFIC TOPICS FOR THE ANALYSTS TO ADDRESS AND PUT
THE FIRMS ON NOTICE THAT, AS PART OF THE UNDERWRITER-SELECTION
PROCESS, IT WOULD CONSIDER EACH ANALYST'S VIEWS OF THE
COMPANY AND WHETHER THE ANALYST'S VALUATION WAS CONSISTENT
WITH THE FIRM'S INVESTMENT BANKERS' VALUATION. BARCLAYS'
RESEARCH ANALYST PRESENTED TO THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE
EQUITY OWNERS THEREBY PARTICIPATING IN THE FIRM'S EFFORTS TO
SOLICIT INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS FROM THE COMPANY. THE
FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT BARCLAYS OFFERED FAVORABLE
RESEARCH TO INDUCE THE COMPANY TO AWARD THE FIRM ITS
INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS. THE FIRM'S ANALYST'S PRESENTATION
TO THE COMPANY AND THE PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS SUPPORTED THE
FIRM'S INVESTMENT BANKING PITCH AND OFFERED A POSITIVE
EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY. MOREOVER, FOLLOWING THE ANALYST'S
PRESENTATION, THE COMPANY ASKED BARCLAYS TO COMPLETE A
TEMPLATE SHOWING AN "EQUITY COMMITMENT COMMITTEE APPROV[ED]"
VALUATION OF THE COMPANY, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE ANALYST'S
VIEWS ON THE COMPANY'S VALUATION. THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE
EQUITY OWNERS ASKED THE FIRMS TO COMPLETE THE TEMPLATE AND
PROVIDE A FIRM-WIDE VALUATION THAT THE FIRM, INCLUDING ITS
ANALYST, WOULD BE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT AFTER THE COMPANY
AWARDED ITS IPO BUSINESS, ABSENT UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS.
INDEED, THE COMPANY TOLD SOME FIRMS, INCLUDING BARCLAYS, THAT
THE PURPOSE OF THE TEMPLATE WAS TO PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM
BEING "BURNED" BY AN ANALYST'S DECISION TO ADOPT A NEGATIVE VIEW
OF THE COMPANY AFTER IT HAD AWARDED ITS INVESTMENT BANKING
BUSINESS TO THE ANALYST'S FIRM. BARCLAYS COMPLIED WITH THE
COMPANY'S REQUEST. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT BARCLAYS
FAILED TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE WRITTEN SUPERVISORY
PROCEDURES GOVERNING ANALYST INVOLVEMENT IN INVESTMENT
BANKING SOLICITATIONS AND OFFERS OF FAVORABLE RESEARCH
COVERAGE. SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL AT BARCLAYS WERE AWARE THAT
THE COMPANY HAD ASKED THE FIRM'S RESEARCH ANALYST TO MAKE A
PRESENTATION TO THE COMPANY THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE
ANALYST'S DUE DILIGENCE, THAT THE COMPANY WOULD TAKE THE
PRESENTATION INTO ACCOUNT WHEN AWARDING THE UNDERWRITING
MANDATE IN ITS IPO, THAT THE PRESENTATION WOULD INCLUDE THE
ANALYST'S FAVORABLE VIEWS OF THE COMPANY, AND THAT THE
COMPANY WANTED A FINAL VALUATION THAT THE ENTIRE FIRM,
INCLUDING ITS ANALYST, WOULD SUPPORT IF SELECTED AS AN
UNDERWRITER. NEVERTHELESS, THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL
ALLOWED THE ANALYST TO MAKE THE PRESENTATION.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT TO WIN
INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS FROM A COMPANY, BARCLAYS' EQUITY
RESEARCH ANALYST PARTICIPATED IN THE
FIRM'S EFFORTS TO SOLICIT INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS FROM THE
COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PLANNED INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
(IPO). THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE
EQUITY OWNERS INVITED BARCLAYS AND OTHER BROKER-DEALERS TO
COMPETE FOR A ROLE IN THE COMPANY'S IPO. BEFORE THE COMPANY
AWARDED ITS IPO BUSINESS, IT ASKED THE EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS
FROM THE FIRMS COMPETING FOR THE BUSINESS TO MAKE
PRESENTATIONS TO THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY
OWNERS. THE COMPANY PROVIDED SPECIFIC TOPICS FOR THE ANALYSTS
TO ADDRESS AND PUT THE FIRMS ON NOTICE THAT, AS PART OF THE
UNDERWRITER-SELECTION PROCESS, IT WOULD CONSIDER EACH
ANALYST'S VIEWS OF THE COMPANY AND WHETHER THE ANALYST'S

PRESENTATIONS TO THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY
OWNERS. THE COMPANY PROVIDED SPECIFIC TOPICS FOR THE ANALYSTS
TO ADDRESS AND PUT THE FIRMS ON NOTICE THAT, AS PART OF THE
UNDERWRITER-SELECTION PROCESS, IT WOULD CONSIDER EACH
ANALYST'S VIEWS OF THE COMPANY AND WHETHER THE ANALYST'S
VALUATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM'S INVESTMENT BANKERS'
VALUATION. BARCLAYS' RESEARCH ANALYST PRESENTED TO THE
COMPANY AND ITS PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS THEREBY PARTICIPATING IN
THE FIRM'S EFFORTS TO SOLICIT INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS FROM
THE COMPANY. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT BARCLAYS OFFERED
FAVORABLE RESEARCH TO INDUCE THE COMPANY TO AWARD THE FIRM
ITS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS BECAUSE THE ANALYST'S
PRESENTATION TO THE COMPANY AND THE PRIVATE EQUITY OWNERS
OFFERED A POSITIVE EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY. FOLLOWING THE
ANALYST'S PRESENTATION, THE COMPANY ASKED BARCLAYS TO
COMPLETE A TEMPLATE SHOWING AN "EQUITY COMMITMENT COMMITTEE
APPROV[ED]" VALUATION OF THE COMPANY, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A
FIRM-WIDE VALUATION THAT THE FIRM, INCLUDING ITS ANALYST, WOULD
BE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT AFTER THE COMPANY AWARDED ITS IPO
BUSINESS, ABSENT UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS. THE COMPANY TOLD
SOME FIRMS, INCLUDING BARCLAYS, THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE
TEMPLATE WAS TO PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM BEING "BURNED" BY
AN ANALYST'S DECISION TO ADOPT A NEGATIVE VIEW OF THE COMPANY
AFTER IT HAD AWARDED ITS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS TO THE
ANALYST'S FIRM. BARCLAYS PROVIDED THE REQUESTED TEMPLATE. THE
FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT BARCLAYS FAILED TO ADOPT AND
IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
GOVERNING ANALYST INVOLVEMENT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
SOLICITATIONS AND OFFERS OF FAVORABLE
RESEARCH COVERAGE BECAUSE BARCLAYS WAS AWARE THAT THE
COMPANY HAD ASKED THE FIRM'S RESEARCH ANALYST TO MAKE A
PRESENTATION TO THE COMPANY THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE
ANALYST'S DUE DILIGENCE AND THAT THE COMPANY WOULD TAKE THE
PRESENTATION INTO ACCOUNT WHEN AWARDING THE UNDERWRITING
MANDATE IN ITS IPO. NEVERTHELESS, THE ANALYST WAS ALLOWED TO
MAKE THE PRESENTATION.

COMMISSION IS A PARTY, AND WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE
FINDINGS HEREIN, EXCEPT AS TO THE COMMISSION'S JURISDICTION
OVER IT AND THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH
ARE ADMITTED, RESPONDENT CONSENTS TO THE ENTRY OF THIS ORDER
INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER. THIS MATTER CONCERNS VIOLATIONS OF THE
ADVISERS ACT BY BCI, ARISING FROM SYSTEMIC FAILURES AT BCI AFTER
IT ACQUIRED A COMPANY'S ADVISORY BUSINESS IN SEPTEMBER 2008.
WHEN BCI ATTEMPTED TO INTEGRATE THIS ADVISORY BUSINESS INTO ITS
EXISTING BUSINESS, IT DID NOT TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO
ASSURE THAT ITS INFRASTRUCTURE WAS ENHANCED TO SUPPORT THE
NEWLY ACQUIRED ADVISORY BUSINESS, IT FAILED TO ADOPT AND
IMPLEMENT WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF THE ADVISERS ACT, AND IT
FAILED TO MAKE AND KEEP CERTAIN REQUIRED BOOKS AND RECORDS.
THESE DEFICIENCIES CONTRIBUTED TO OTHER VIOLATIONS.
SPECIFICALLY, BCI EXECUTED MORE THAN 1,500 PRINCIPAL
TRANSACTIONS WITH ITS ADVISORY CLIENT ACCOUNTS WITHOUT MAKING
THE REQUIRED WRITTEN DISCLOSURES OR OBTAINING CLIENT CONSENT.
ADDITIONALLY, FOR 2,785 ADVISORY CLIENT ACCOUNTS, BCI CHARGED
COMMISSIONS AND FEES, AND EARNED REVENUES, THAT WERE
INCONSISTENT WITH ITS DISCLOSURE TO CLIENTS. BCI ALSO VIOLATED
CERTAIN OF THE CUSTODY PROVISIONS (THE CUSTODY RULE) OF THE
ADVISERS ACT, BECAUSE IT DID NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE PROCEDURE
FOR IDENTIFYING AND EXTRACTING CERTAIN CLIENT INFORMATION FROM
ITS SYSTEMS, ITS WEALTH MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT ADVISORY
BUSINESS DID NOT IDENTIFY MORE THAN 800 OF ITS ADVISORY
ACCOUNTS TO THE INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT THAT
PERFORMED BCI'S 2010 ANNUAL SURPRISE EXAMINATION; AND BCI
UNDERREPORTED ITS ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ("AUM") ON ITS
MARCH 31, 2011 AMENDMENT TO ITS FORM ADV BY $754 MILLION. BCI'S
VIOLATIONS RESULTED IN OVERCHARGES AND CLIENT LOSSES
APPROXIMATING $472,000, AND ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO BCI OF MORE
THAN $3.1 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE,
BCI WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 204(A) OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND
RULES 204-2(A)(8) AND (A)(15) THEREUNDER, SECTION 206(2) OF THE
ADVISERS ACT, SECTION 206(3) OF THE ADVISERS ACT, SECTION 206(4) OF

A FINRA HEARING OFFICER CONSIDERED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT AND
CONSENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN FINRA ON BEHALF OF NYSE
REGULATION, INC. AND THE FIRM. WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING ANY
ALLEGATIONS OR FINDINGS, THE HEARING OFFICER ACCEPTED THE
OFFER OF SETTLEMENT AND CONSENT AND ISSUED A DECISION. THE
FIRM RECORDED THE DETAILS OF ALL OPTIONS ORDERS AND
EXECUTIONS USING AN ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CALLED THE
LISTED OPTIONS TRADING SYSTEM (LOTS). VARIOUS INADEQUACIES WITH
LOTS RESULTED IN SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES TO THE FIRM'S OPTIONS
ORDER AND DEALER TICKETS. THESE DEFICIENCIES WERE ASSOCIATED
WITH ALL MANUALLY EXECUTED OPTIONS ORDERS (I.E., EXECUTED BY A
FLOOR BROKER). - ORDERS SENT FROM CLIENTS ELECTRONICALLY TO
THE FIRM'S SMART ORDER ROUTERS FOR EXECUTION AT THE VARIOUS
EXCHANGES WERE NOT IMPACTED.-THE FIRM'S ORDER TICKETS
INACCURATELY REFLECTED THE ORDER RECEIPT TIME FOR ALL
CUSTOMER OPTIONS ORDERS THAT WERE EXECUTED BY A FLOOR
BROKER. THE FIRM'S ORDER TICKETS FAILED TO REFLECT THE
TRANSMISSION TIME FOR ALL OPTIONS ORDERS THAT WERE EXECUTED
BY A FLOOR BROKER, AND THE FIRM FAILED TO MAINTAIN THIS TIME IN AN
EASILY ACCESSIBLE PLACE. THE FIRM WAS UNABLE TO CAPTURE
MODIFICATIONS TO ALL OPTIONS ORDERS THAT WERE EXECUTED BY
FLOOR BROKERS THAT DID NOT UTILIZE A LOTS USER INTERFACE (NONCONNECTED BROKERS). BECAUSE THE FIRM BOOKED SUCH TRADES AT
THE END OF THE DAY, ITS ORDER TICKETS REFLECTED ONLY THE FINAL
QUANTITY AND PRICE; MODIFICATIONS TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER
QUANTITIES WERE INACCURATELY CAPTURED ON THE FIRM'S ORDER
TICKETS AS NEW ORDERS. MOREOVER, FOR ALL OPTIONS ORDERS
EXECUTED BY NON-CONNECTED BROKERS DURING THE RELEVANT
PERIOD, THE FIRM'S TICKETS INACCURATELY CAPTURED EXECUTION
TIME AS THE TIME THE FIRM BOOKED THE TRADE INTO LOTS AT THE END
OF THE DAY. FROM APPROXIMATELY SEPTEMBER 2008 THROUGH MAY
2010, FOR ALL OPTIONS ORDERS THAT WERE EXECUTED BY A FLOOR
BROKER, THE FIRM'S TICKETS REFLECTED THE DEFAULT MARKET
CENTER WHERE THE FLOOR BROKER TRADED, AND NOT THE ACTUAL
EXCHANGE UPON WHICH THE ORDER WAS EXECUTED (IF DIFFERENT).
THIS WAS IN VIOLATIONS OF EXCHANGE ACT RULES 17A-3(A) AND 17A4(B), AND NYSE ARCA OPTIONS RULES 6.68(A) AND 11.16(A). DURING THE
RELEVANT PERIOD, THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
FAILED TO INCLUDE ANY SUPERVISORY REVIEWS TO ENSURE THE
ACCURACY OF ITS OPTIONS BROKERAGE ORDER AND DEALER TICKETS.
MOREOVER, THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES DID NOT
CONTAIN ANY OPTIONS-RELATED PROVISIONS, INCLUDING PROVISIONS
RELATING TO NYSE AREA OPTIONS RULES AND REGULATIONS.
NOTWITHSTANDING ITS WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES, THE FIRM
FAILED TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN, AND ENFORCE A SYSTEM REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO SUPERVISE THE OPERATIONS OF ITS BUSINESS AND

Allegations:

A FINRA HEARING OFFICER ACCEPTED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT AND
CONSENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN FINRA ON BEHALF OF NYSE
REGULATION, INC. AND THE FIRM FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SETTLING
THE PROCEEDING WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING ANY ALLEGATIONS
OR FINDINGS. DURING THE PERIOD OF SEPTEMBER 2008 THROUGH
DECEMBER 2012, THE FIRM FAILED TO ACCURATELY MAKE, KEEP
CURRENT AND PRESERVE IN AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE PLACE CERTAIN
BROKERAGE ORDER AND DEALER TICKETS FOR OPTIONS ORDERS IT
EXECUTED. VARIOUS INADEQUACIES WITH THE FIRM'S OPTIONS TRADING
SYSTEM RESULTED IN SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES TO THE FIRM'S OPTIONS
ORDER AND DEALER TICKETS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONS ORDERS
EXECUTED BY A FLOOR BROKER. ORDERS SENT FROM CLIENTS
ELECTRONICALLY TO THE FIRM'S SMART ORDER ROUTERS FOR
EXECUTION AT THE VARIOUS EXCHANGES WERE NOT IMPACTED. IN
PARTICULAR, THOSE ORDER TICKETS INACCURATELY REFLECTED THE
ORDER RECEIPT TIME, FAILED TO REFLECT THE TRANSMISSION TIME, DID
NOT CAPTURE ALL MODIFICATIONS AND, CERTAIN OF THOSE ORDERS,
INACCURATELY CAPTURED EXECUTION TIME AS THE TIME THE FIRM
BOOKED THE
TRADE. IN ADDITION, FROM APPROXIMATELY SEPTEMBER 2008 THROUGH
MAY 2010, THOSE TICKETS REFLECTED THE DEFAULT MARKET CENTER
WHERE THE FLOOR BROKER TRADED, AND NOT THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE
UPON WHICH THE ORDER WAS
EXECUTED (IF DIFFERENT). THESE FINDINGS CONSTITUTE VIOLATIONS OF
EXCHANGE ACT RULES 17A-3(A) AND 17A-4(B), AND NYSE ARCA OPTIONS
RULES 6.68(A) AND 11.16(A). DURING THE
RELEVANT PERIOD, THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
FAILED TO INCLUDE ANY SUPERVISORY REVIEWS TO ENSURE THE
ACCURACY OF ITS OPTIONS BROKERAGE ORDER AND DEALER TICKETS,
AND THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES DID NOT CONTAIN
ANY OPTIONS-RELATED PROVISIONS, INCLUDING PROVISIONS RELATING
TO NYSE AREA OPTIONS RULES AND REGULATIONS IN VIOLATION OF
NYSE AREA OPTIONS RULE 11.18. HOWEVER, IN DETERMINING TO
RESOLVE THIS MATTER ON THE BASIS SET FORTH IN THE OFFER OF
SETTLEMENT AND CONSENT, FINRA CONSIDERED THAT, IN DECEMBER
2012, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED, AT
SIGNIFICANT COST, A NEW OPTIONS PLATFORM TO REPLACE LOTS.

ERRONEOUSLY REPORTED LONG SALE CROSSING SESSION II (CSII)
TRANSACTIONS TO THE NYSE AS SHORT SALES IN VIOLATIONS OF RULE
200(G) OF REG SHO AND NYSE RULE 476(A)(10). CSII IS ONE OF THE NYSE
OFF-HOURS TRADING FACILITIES WHICH OPERATES FROM 4:00 P.M. TO
6:15 P.M. THIS SESSION ACCOMMODATES THE TRADING OF BASKETS OF
AT LEAST 15 NYSE SECURITIES VALUED AT $1 MILLION OR MORE.
REPORTS OF EXECUTION ARE AVAILABLE TO MEMBER FIRMS VIA THE
WEB-BASED ELECTRONIC FILING PLATFORM (EFP) SHORTLY AFTER THE
TRADE IS ENTERED. AT 6:15 P.M., THE NYSE PRINTS TO THE
CONSOLIDATED TAPE THE AGGREGATE INFORMATION OF ALL BASKETS
EXECUTED IN THIS SESSION (I.E. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES AND
TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF THE AGGREGATE-PRICE TRADES). THE
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT STOCKS INVOLVED IN THE AGGREGATE-PRICE
TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT REPORTED TO THE CONSOLIDATED TAPE. ON
THE THIRD DAY AFTER TRADE DATE (T+3), THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT
STOCKS EXECUTED AS PART OF A CSII BASKET TRADE ARE PRINTED IN
AGGREGATE FORM IN THE NYSE DAILY SALES REPORT. FOR ALL
RELEVANT PERIODS, THE FIRM UTILIZED ITS DOMESTIC PROGRAM
TRADING (DPT) SYSTEM TO REPORT CSII TRANSACTIONS TO THE NYSE.

COMPLIANCE WITH CSII REPORTING TO THE NYSE. PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER
2013, THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE ANY WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES

RETRIEVE NECESSARY RECORDS WITHIN THE REQUIRED PERIOD OF

RECORDS WERE BEING STORED, INCLUDING WHETHER THEY WERE

FORMAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PRIOR TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE
WORM COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT WERE DESIGNED TO VERIFY THAT THE

MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ASSOCIATION. THE FIRM'S PRACTICE OF
OBTAINING REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE VOLUNTARY PAYMENTS TO THE
MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ASSOCIATION FROM THE PROCEEDS OF
MUNICIPAL AND STATE BOND OFFERINGS WAS UNFAIR. THESE
ASSESSMENTS DID NOT BEAR A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO ANY
ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED WITH RESPECT TO EACH BOND OFFERING AND
THE FIRM WAS NOT REQUIRED BY ANY STATUTE OR REGULATION TO BE A

EXPENSE OF EACH TRANSACTION, AND REQUESTED AND RECEIVED
REIMBURSEMENT OF THOSE PAYMENTS FROM THE PROCEEDS OF EACH

OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS BEGINNING AT LEAST AS EARLY AS

EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN AT LEAST NEW YORK, LONDON AND TOKYO,
ATTEMPTED TO MANIPULATE, AND MADE FALSE, MISLEADING OR
KNOWINGLY INACCURATE SUBMISSIONS CONCERNING, TWO GLOBAL
BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES, LIBOR AND EURIBOR.
DURING THE PERIOD FROM AT LEAST MID-2005 THROUGH THE FALL OF
2007, AND SPORADICALLY THEREAFTER INTO 2009, BARCLAYS BASED ITS
LIBOR SUBMISSIONS FOR U.S. DOLLAR (AND AT LIMITED TIMES OTHER
CURRENCIES) ON THE REQUESTS OF CURRENT AND FORMER BARCLAYS
SWAPS TRADERS WHO WERE ATTEMPTING TO AFFECT THE OFFICIAL
LIBOR RATE IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THEIR DERIVATIVES TRADING
POSITIONS. THIS SAME CONDUCT OCCURRED WITH RESPECT TO
BARCLAYS' EURIBOR SUBMISSIONS DURING THE PERIOD OF AT LEAST
MID-2005 THROUGH MID-2009.
DURING THE PERIOD FROM APPROXIMATELY MID-2005 THROUGH AT
LEAST MID-2008, CERTAIN BARCLAYS EURO SWAPS TRADERS
COORDINATED WITH AND AIDED AND ABETTED TRADERS AT CERTAIN
OTHER BANKS TO INFLUENCE THE EURIBOR SUBMISSIONS OF MULTIPLE
BANKS, INCLUDING BARCLAYS, IN ORDER TO AFFECT THE OFFICIAL
EURIBOR RATE AND THEREBY BENEFIT THEIR RESPECTIVE DERIVATIVES
TRADING POSITIONS.
DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF LATE AUGUST 2007 THROUGH EARLY
2009, BARCLAYS LOWERED ITS LIBOR SUBMISSIONS IN ORDER TO
MANAGE WHAT IT BELIEVED TO BE AN INACCURATE AND NEGATIVE
PUBLIC AND MEDIA PERCEPTION THAT BARCLAYS HAD A LIQUIDITY
PROBLEM, BASED IN PART ON ITS HIGH LIBOR SUBMISSIONS RELATIVE TO
SUBMISSIONS OF OTHER BANKS THAT BARCLAYS BELIEVED WERE TOO
LOW GIVEN MARKET CONDITIONS. PURSUANT TO A DIRECTIVE BY
CERTAIN MEMBERS OF BARCLAYS' SENIOR MANAGEMENT, BARCLAYS
SUBMITTED LOWER RATES FOR U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR, AND AT LIMITED
TIMES YEN AND STERLING LIBOR, THAN WHAT IT HAD DETERMINED TO BE
THE APPROPRIATE RATES.
BARCLAYS' LACK OF SPECIFIC INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
CONCERNING ITS SUBMISSION PROCESSES FOR LIBOR AND EURIBOR
AND ITS INADEQUATE SUPERVISION OF TRADING DESKS ALLOWED THIS

THE CFTC EXPRESSLY NOTED BARCLAYS' SIGNIFICANT COOPERATION
DURING THE INVESTIGATION.
IN A RELATED MATTER, UNDER A NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT ("NPA")
DATED JUNE 26, 2012 WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CRIMINAL
DIVISION, FRAUD SECTION ("DOJ"), BARCLAYS BANK PLC AND ITS PARENT,
SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, "BARCLAYS") ADMIT,
ACCEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT SET
FORTH BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE STATEMENT OF FACTS
("STATEMENT") ATTACHED TO THE NPA. FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF
THE STATEMENT:
FROM APPROXIMATELY 2005 THROUGH 2007, AND OCCASIONALLY
THEREAFTER THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 2009, CERTAIN BARCLAYS
SWAPS TRADERS REQUESTED THAT CERTAIN BARCLAYS LIBOR AND
EURIBOR SUBMITTERS SUBMIT LIBOR AND EURIBOR CONTRIBUTIONS
THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE TRADERS' TRADING POSITIONS, RATHER THAN
RATES THAT COMPLIED WITH THE DEFINITIONS OF LIBOR AND EURIBOR.
THE SUBMITTERS ACCOMMODATED THESE REQUESTS ON NUMEROUS
OCCASIONS. IN ADDITION, IN SOME INSTANCES FROM AT LEAST AS EARLY
AS AUGUST 2006 THROUGH APPROXIMATELY JANUARY 2007, AND THEN
ON ANOTHER OCCASION IN OR ABOUT JUNE 2009, BARCLAYS YEN SWAPS
TRADERS MADE REQUESTS TO BARCLAYS YEN LIBOR SUBMITTERS FOR
FAVORABLE YEN LIBOR SETTINGS. BARCLAYS YEN LIBOR SUBMITTERS
ACCOMMODATED THOSE REQUESTS ON SOME OCCASIONS. THE
PURPOSE OF THIS ACTIVITY WAS TO MANIPULATE BARCLAYS' DOLLAR
AND YEN LIBOR CONTRIBUTIONS AND ITS EURIBOR CONTRIBUTIONS AND
TO INFLUENCE THE RESULTING LIBOR AND EURIBOR FIXES. ALSO, FROM
AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY AUGUST 2005 THROUGH AT LEAST
APPROXIMATELY MAY 2008, CERTAIN BARCLAYS SWAPS TRADERS MADE
REQUESTS OF SWAPS TRADERS AT OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR
FAVORABLE LIBOR AND EURIBOR CONTRIBUTIONS. SUBMISSIONS BY
BARCLAYS THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT REQUESTS FROM SWAPS
TRADERS FOR FAVORABLE TREATMENT WERE FALSE AND MISLEADING.
FROM APPROXIMATELY AUGUST 2007 THROUGH AT LEAST
APPROXIMATELY JANUARY 2009, BARCLAYS OFTEN SUBMITTED
INACCURATE DOLLAR LIBORS THAT UNDER-REPORTED ITS PERCEPTION
OF ITS BORROWING COSTS AND ITS ASSESSMENT OF AN APPROPRIATE

BOTH INVOLVED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE OFFERING DOCUMENTS
FOR EACH SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIZATION
(RMBS) AND SOLD THESE SECURITIES TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.
SUBPRIME RMBS SECURITIES ARE CREATED WHEN POOLS OF SUBPRIME
MORTGAGES ARE COLLECTED AND THE CASH FLOWS ARE
REDISTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENT BOND CLASSES CALLED TRANCHES. ON
DECEMBER 5, 2005, REGULATION AB BECAME EFFECTIVE. UNDER
REGULATION AB, ISSUERS OF RMBS ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE

IN ORDER TO SELL A NEW SECURITIZATION, THE FIRM WAS REQUIRED TO
POST DATA ON HOW SIMILAR SECURITIZATIONS THAT IT HAD
UNDERWRITTEN HAD PERFORMED IN THE PAST. THIS DISCLOSURE
REQUIREMENT COULD BE SATISFIED BY POSTING THE HISTORICAL
DELINQUENCY DATA ON A REG AB WEBSITE WITH A SPECIFIC INTERNET
ADDRESS, WHICH FOR SECURITIZATIONS ISSUED ON OR AFTER JANUARY
1, 2006, IS DEEMED TO BE PART OF THE PROSPECTUS. IN OR ABOUT
OCTOBER 2006, THE FIRM LEARNED THAT A TRUSTEE EMPLOYED ON
CERTAIN OF ITS SUBPRIME SECURITIZATIONS (THE TRUSTEE) HAD
PROVIDED ERRONEOUS MORTGAGE DELINQUENCY DATA IN ITS
REPORTS. THIS DELINQUENCY DATA WAS USED TO POPULATE THE FIRM'S
REG AB WEBSITE. AFTER THE FIRM NOTIFIED THE TRUSTEE ABOUT THE
ERRONEOUS MORTGAGE DELINQUENCY DATA, THE TRUSTEE CONFIRMED
IT HAD PROVIDED TO THE FIRM INACCURATE DATA ON MORTGAGE
DELINQUENCIES FOR FOUR SUBPRIME RMBS FOR THE PERIOD FROM
MARCH 2006 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2006. THE TRUSTEE SUBSEQUENTLY
ADVISED THE FIRM THAT IT HAD RESOLVED THE PROBLEMS UNDERLYING
THESE REPORTING ERRORS AND HAD UPLOADED CORRECTED DATA TO
ITS INVESTOR REPORTING WEBSITE IN NOVEMBER 2006. THE FIRM DID
NOT UPLOAD CORRECTED DATA TO ITS REG AB WEBSITE. HOWEVER,
PRIOR TO MARCH 2007, THE INACCURATE DELINQUENCY DATA POSTED
ON THE FIRM'S REG AB WEBSITE WAS IMMATERIAL. FROM JANUARY 2006
AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 2007, THE HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY
INFORMATION DISPLAYED ON THE FIRM'S REG AB WEBSITE DID NOT
PRESENT THE PERFORMANCE HISTORY OF THE MORTGAGES IN EACH
INDIVIDUAL SECURITIZATION. RATHER, THE INFORMATION ON THE
PERFORMANCE OF MORTGAGES IN RMBS DEALS SECURITIZED BY THE
FIRM WAS PROVIDED IN "MASTER POOLS." EACH MASTER POOL
CONTAINED THE HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY INFORMATION FOR
NUMEROUS PRIOR SECURITIZATIONS, GENERALLY ALL THE RMBS THAT
THE FIRM HAD UNDERWRITTEN IN A CALENDAR YEAR. THUS, AN
INVESTOR WHO ACCESSED THE REG AB WEBSITE WOULD SEE
PERFORMANCE FIGURES FOR ALL MORTGAGES ISSUED IN 2006, BUT
WOULD NOT SEE HOW MORTGAGES WERE PERFORMING IN EACH
INDIVIDUAL RMBS. IN MARCH 2007, THE FIRM RECONFIGURED ITS REG AB
WEBSITE TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO VIEW HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE
INFORMATION FOR SIMILAR SUBPRIME RMBS ON A DEAL-BY-DEAL BASIS.
BY ERROR, DURING THESE CHANGES TO THE WEBSITE, FOR THREE
SUBPRIME RMBS THE FIRM POSTED THE SAME INACCURATE
DELINQUENCY FIGURES THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN USED IN THE
MASTER POOL DATA FOR THE SAME SECURITIZATIONS FOR THE PERIOD
FROM MARCH 2006 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2006. THE FIRM DID NOT
ENSURE THAT THE CORRECTED TRUSTEE DATA WAS USED TO POPULATE
THE REG AB WEBSITE, AND DID NOT DETECT THIS ERROR. THE

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FIRM CORRECTED THE POSTED INFORMATION

SPECIFICALLY, FOR EACH OF TWO SUBPRIME RMBS, INACCURATE

APPROXIMATELY NINE MONTHS. THE INACCURATE INFORMATION ON
THESE TWO RMBS WAS HYPERLINKED TO FIVE SUBSEQUENT RMBS

THESE TWO RMBS WAS HYPERLINKED TO FIVE SUBSEQUENT RMBS
SECURITIZATIONS TOTALING $3,968,123,000. THE OFFERING MATERIALS
FOR THESE FIVE SECURITIZATIONS REFERRED INVESTORS TO THE FIRM'S
REG AB WEBSITE THAT INCLUDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
INACCURATE DATA. SIMILARLY INACCURATE INFORMATION ON MORTGAGE
PERFORMANCE WAS ALSO POSTED ON THE FIRM'S REG AB WEBSITE FOR
ANOTHER SUBPRIME RMBS, BUT FOR THIS SECURITIZATION, SUCH
DELINQUENCY INFORMATION WAS MISSTATED FOR A PERIOD OF ONLY
ONE MONTH. BECAUSE OF THESE ERRORS, WHICH VARIOUSLY UNDERREPORTED AND OVER-REPORTED THE EXTENT OF DELINQUENT LOANS IN
THE REFERENCED SECURITIZATIONS, THE FAIR MARKET VALUE, THE
YIELDS ON THE CERTIFICATES, ANTICIPATED HOLDING PERIODS AND
ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE OF THE SUBSEQUENT RMBS
SECURITIZATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY EVALUATED BY
POTENTIAL INVESTORS. AS THE UNDERWRITER AND SELLER OF
SUBPRIME RMBS, THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH A REASONABLE
SYSTEM TO SUPERVISE THE MAINTENANCE, UPDATING AND REVIEW OF
ITS REG AB WEBSITE-IN PARTICULAR, BY FAILING TO PROVIDE FOR
FOLLOW-UP AND REVIEW OF SUPERVISION WITH REGARD TO THE
ACCURACY OF ITS REG AB WEBSITE. IN MARCH 2007, WHEN THE FIRM
RECONFIGURED ITS REG AB WEBSITE TO ALLOW ITS INVESTORS TO VIEW
HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE INFORMATION ON A DEAL-BY-DEAL BASIS,
THE FIRM DID NOT ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION BEING POSTED WAS
ACCURATE. AFTER THE REG AB WEBSITE HAD BEEN RECONFIGURED, THE
FIRM DID NOT TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO IDENTIFY AND CORRECT THE
INACCURATE INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT SUBSEQUENT RMBS
OFFERINGS WOULD BE SOLD ON THE BASIS OF ACCURATE INFORMATION.
