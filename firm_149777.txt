What is included in a BrokerCheck report?
BrokerCheck reports for individual brokers include information such as employment history, professional
qualifications, disciplinary actions, criminal convictions, civil judgments and arbitration awards. BrokerCheck
reports for brokerage firms include information on a firm’s profile, history, and operations, as well as many of the
same disclosure events mentioned above.
Please note that the information contained in a BrokerCheck report may include pending actions or
allegations that may be contested, unresolved or unproven. In the end, these actions or allegations may be
resolved in favor of the broker or brokerage firm, or concluded through a negotiated settlement with no
admission or finding of wrongdoing.
Where did this information come from?
The information contained in BrokerCheck comes from FINRA’s Central Registration Depository, or
CRD® and is a combination of:
o information FINRA and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) require brokers and
brokerage firms to submit as part of the registration and licensing process, and
o information that regulators report regarding disciplinary actions or allegations against firms or brokers.
How current is this information?
Generally, active brokerage firms and brokers are required to update their professional and disciplinary
information in CRD within 30 days. Under most circumstances, information reported by brokerage firms, brokers
and regulators is available in BrokerCheck the next business day.
What if I want to check the background of an investment adviser firm or investment adviser
representative?
To check the background of an investment adviser firm or representative, you can search for the firm or
individual in BrokerCheck. If your search is successful, click on the link provided to view the available licensing
and registration information in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website at
https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. In the alternative, you may search the IAPD website directly or contact your
state securities regulator at http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/P455414.
Are there other resources I can use to check the background of investment professionals?
FINRA recommends that you learn as much as possible about an investment professional before
deciding to work with them. Your state securities regulator can help you research brokers and investment adviser
representatives doing business in your state.

Disclosure Event Details
What you should know about reported disclosure events:
1. BrokerCheck provides details for any disclosure event that was reported in CRD. It also includes
summary information regarding FINRA arbitration awards in cases where the brokerage firm was
named as a respondent.
2. Certain thresholds must be met before an event is reported to CRD, for example:
o A law enforcement agency must file formal charges before a brokerage firm is required to disclose a
particular criminal event.
3. Disclosure events in BrokerCheck reports come from different sources:
o Disclosure events for this brokerage firm were reported by the firm and/or regulators. When the firm
and a regulator report information for the same event, both versions of the event will appear in the
BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source
labeled.
4. There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:
o A disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, or final.
§ A "pending" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated.
§ An event that is "on appeal" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently
being appealed.
§ A "final" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.
o A final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled or otherwise resolved.
§ An "adjudicated" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter,
or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party
charged with some alleged wrongdoing.
§ A "settled" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter.
Please note that firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for
business or other reasons.
§ A "resolved" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of
wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker. Such matters generally involve customer
disputes.
5. You may wish to contact the brokerage firm to obtain further information regarding any of the
disclosure events contained in this BrokerCheck report.

Regulatory - Final
This type of disclosure event involves (1) a final, formal proceeding initiated by a regulatory authority (e.g., a state
securities agency, self-regulatory organization, federal regulator such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
foreign financial regulatory body) for a violation of investment-related rules or regulations; or (2) a revocation or
suspension of the authority of a brokerage firm or its control affiliate to act as an attorney, accountant or federal
contractor.

TRANSFER INFORMATION WERE IMPACTED BY SIGNIFICANT DESIGN
LIMITATIONS AND PROGRAMING FLAWS, WHICH AFFECTED THE
TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN TRANSACTION RELATED INFORMATION TO
THE FIRM'S AUTOMATED TRANSACTION MONITORING SYSTEM. AS A
CONSEQUENCE, THE FIRM FAILED TO SURVEIL WIRE AND FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSFERS, INCLUDING TRANSFERS TO AND FROM
COUNTRIES KNOWN FOR HAVING HIGH MONEY LAUNDERING RISK. THE
FIRM ALSO FAILED TO DEVOTE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO REVIEW
ALERTS GENERATED BY ITS AUTOMATED AML SYSTEM, AND AS A RESULT,
ITS AML ANALYSTS OFTEN CLOSED ALERTS WITHOUT SUFFICIENTLY
CONDUCTING OR DOCUMENTING THEIR INVESTIGATIONS OF THE
POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS WIRE TRANSFERS THAT GENERATED THE
ALERTS. THE FIRM'S AML DEPARTMENT FAILED TO REASONABLY MONITOR
CUSTOMERS' DEPOSITS AND TRADES OF LOW PRICED SECURITIES
(PENNY STOCK) FOR POTENTIAL AML ISSUES, INCLUDING INSIDER
TRADING AND MARKET MANIPULATIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED
THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SUPERVISORY
SYSTEM REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH
SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (SECTION 5) AND
APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, THE FIRM DIVIDED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR VETTING ITS CUSTOMERS' DEPOSITS AND SALES
OF PENNY STOCK AMONG ITS BRANCH MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE
DEPARTMENT AND EXECUTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES (EFS) DEPARTMENT
WITHOUT REASONABLE COORDINATION AMONG THEM. NONE OF THESE
GROUPS, ALONE OR TOGETHER, CONDUCTED A SEARCHING INQUIRY TO
DETERMINE WHETHER PENNY STOCK DEPOSITED AT THE FIRM WAS
ELIGIBLE FOR IMMEDIATE RESALE TO THE PUBLIC. INSTEAD, THE FIRM
UNDULY RELIED ON CUSTOMERS' SELF-CERTIFICATIONS AND ISSUERS'
COUNSEL'S REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE STOCK WAS FREELY
TRADEABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE GROUPS FAILED TO CONSISTENTLY
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, EVEN WHEN ONE DETERMINED THAT
A CUSTOMER MIGHT OWN RESTRICTED SECURITIES. AS A RESULT, THE
FIRM FAILED TO REASONABLY EVALUATE THE CUSTOMERS' PENNY STOCK
TRANSACTIONS FOR RED FLAGS INDICATIVE OF POTENTIAL SECTION 5
VIOLATIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THE FIRM HAD IN PLACE BUT
FAILED TO IMPLEMENT ITS POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND INTERNAL
CONTROLS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE
BANK SECRECY ACT AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS BY FAILING
TO CONDUCT RISK BASED REVIEWS OF THE CORRESPONDENT
ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (FFIS).

DISBURSEMENTS FROM CLIENT ACCOUNTS OF OUTGOING WIRE
TRANSFERS AND JOURNALS OF UP TO $100,000 PER DAY PER ACCOUNT
BASED ON THE FA'S ATTESTATION ON AN INTERNAL ELECTRONIC FORM
THAT THE FA HAD RECEIVED A VERBAL REQUEST FROM THE CLIENT BY
PHONE OR IN-PERSON AND PROVIDING CERTAIN DETAILS ABOUT THE
REQUEST. WHILE MSSB POLICIES PROVIDED FOR CERTAIN REVIEWS
PRIOR TO ISSUING THE DISBURSEMENTS, SUCH REVIEWS WERE NOT
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT OR PREVENT AN FA MAKING FALSE
ATTESTATIONS ABOUT HAVING RECEIVED A VERBAL CLIENT REQUEST TO
TRANSFER FUNDS TO A THIRD-PARTY FOR THE FA'S BENEFIT.
MSSB'S INSUFFICIENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CONTRIBUTED TO ITS
FAILURE TO DETECT OR PREVENT AN FA FROM MISAPPROPRIATING
FUNDS FROM CLIENT ACCOUNTS OVER A PERIOD OF NEARLY A YEAR.
FROM DECEMBER 2015 UNTIL NOVEMBER 2016, BARRY F. CONNELL
("CONNELL"), WHILE EMPLOYED AS AN FA, INITIATED OVER $7 MILLION IN
UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS OUT OF THE ACCOUNTS OF FOUR OF HIS
ADVISORY CLIENTS BY MAKING FALSE ATTESTATIONS ON APPROXIMATELY
90 INTERNAL ELECTRONIC FORMS TO INITIATE THIRD-PARTY TRANSFERS
BETWEEN CERTAIN CLIENT ACCOUNTS AND THIRD-PARTY WIRES FROM
CLIENT ACCOUNTS FOR HIS BENEFIT, AS WELL AS BY HIS UNAUTHORIZED
USE OF APPROXIMATELY 20 CLIENT ACCOUNT CHECKS. THROUGH THESE
UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS, CONNELL MISAPPROPRIATED OVER $5
MILLION FROM THE CLIENT ACCOUNTS TO FUND HIS LAVISH LIFESTYLE.
MSSB DID NOT DETECT THAT ANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE
UNAUTHORIZED FOR NEARLY A YEAR UNTIL THE DEFRAUDED CLIENTS
CONTACTED MSSB WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR ACCOUNTS.
ACCORDINGLY, MSSB ALSO FAILED REASONABLY TO SUPERVISE
CONNELL.

Firm Statement

ON JUNE 29, 2018, THE SEC ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT ORDER WITH
MSWM SETTLING AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WHICH RELATES TO
MISAPPROPRIATION OF CLIENT FUNDS IN FOUR RELATED ACCOUNTS BY A
SINGLE FORMER MSWM FINANCIAL ADVISOR ("FA"). THE SEC FOUND THAT
MSWM FAILED TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
OR SYSTEMS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT PERSONNEL FROM
MISAPPROPRIATING ASSETS IN CLIENT ACCOUNTS. THE SEC
SPECIFICALLY FOUND THAT, OVER THE COURSE OF ELEVEN MONTHS,
THE FA INITIATED UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS IN THE FOUR RELATED
CLIENT ACCOUNTS IN ORDER TO MISAPPROPRIATE CLIENT FUNDS. THE
SEC FOUND THAT WHILE MSWM POLICIES PROVIDED FOR CERTAIN
REVIEWS PRIOR TO ISSUING DISBURSEMENTS, SUCH REVIEWS WERE
NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT FAS FROM
MISAPPROPRIATING CLIENT FUNDS. UPON BEING INFORMED OF THE
ISSUE BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FA'S AFFECTED CLIENTS, MSWM
PROMPTLY CONDUCTED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, TERMINATED THE
FA, AND REPORTED THE FRAUD TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.
MSWM ALSO FULLY REPAID THE AFFECTED CLIENTS, MADE SIGNIFICANT
ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND SYSTEMS

THE FINDINGS, TO A CENSURE; TO CEASE AND DESIST FROM COMMITTING

INCLUDING CERTIFICATIONS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION AND
ADEQUACY OF THE ENHANCED MSWM POLICIES AND TO PAY A CIVIL

REQUIRED UNDER FINRA RULE 2264(B) DURING 2012, 2013 AND 2014. THE
FINDINGS STATED THAT FINRA RULE 2264(B) PROVIDES THAT, NOT LESS

RULE TO ALL NON-INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS WITH MARGIN ACCOUNTS.
THESE DISCLOSURES ALERT CUSTOMERS TO RISKS AND PROCEDURES

2014, THE FIRM HAD A PROCESS IN PLACE TO COMPLY WITH ITS
OBLIGATIONS UNDER FINRA RULE 2264(B) THAT RELIED ON VARIOUS
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS PROVIDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES FOR
INCLUSION IN MAILINGS TO CUSTOMERS. PRIOR TO 2015, THE FIRM DID

THAT REQUIRED YEARLY MARGIN DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS UNDER
RULE 2264(B) WERE INCLUDED IN MAILINGS TO CUSTOMERS WITH
MARGIN ACCOUNTS.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM AND WRITTEN
SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS) REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
DETECT AND PREVENT UNSUITABLE SHORT-TERM TRADING OF UNIT
INVESTMENT TRUSTS (UITS). THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM
EXECUTED MORE THAN $33.4 BILLION IN UIT TRANSACTIONS GENERATING
MORE THAN $650 MILLION IN SALES CREDITS AND COMMISSIONS. THE
$33.4 BILLION IN UIT TRANSACTIONS INCLUDED MORE THAN $5.2 BILLION
IN UIT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING "EARLY ROLLOVERS," DEFINED BY THE
FIRM AS UITS ROLLED OVER MORE THAN 100 DAYS BEFORE MATURITY.
THE FIRM FAILED TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE REPRESENTATIVES' SALES
OF UITS IN SEVERAL RESPECTS. FIRST, ALTHOUGH THE FIRM'S
COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES NOTED THAT "UITS ARE INTENDED TO BE
LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS," THE FIRM'S PROCEDURES OFFERED
INSUFFICIENT GUIDANCE TO SUPERVISORS REGARDING HOW THEY
SHOULD MONITOR AND REVIEW UIT TRANSACTIONS TO DETECT
UNSUITABLE SHORT-TERM TRADING OF UITS, INCLUDING SHORT-TERM
ROLLOVERS. ALSO, THE FIRM CONDUCTED NO TRAINING FOR
REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES SPECIFIC TO UITS. THE FINDINGS ALSO
STATED THAT, THE FIRM HAD AN INADEQUATE SYSTEM TO DETECT
POTENTIALLY UNSUITABLE SHORT-TERM UIT ROLLOVERS. THE FIRM'S
ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM ALERTED SUPERVISORS TO SHORT-TERM UIT
"SWITCHES," WHICH THE FIRM'S PROCEDURES DEFINED AS THE
PURCHASE OF A UIT WITHIN 60 DAYS OF THE SALE OF EITHER AN OPENEND MUTUAL FUND OR UIT. WHEN SUCH A SWITCH WAS IDENTIFIED, THE
FIRM REQUIRED THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE PROVIDE A JUSTIFICATION
FOR THE SWITCH, AND A SUPERVISOR REVIEW AND APPROVE THE

FIRM REQUIRED THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE PROVIDE A JUSTIFICATION
FOR THE SWITCH, AND A SUPERVISOR REVIEW AND APPROVE THE
TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS EXECUTION. IF THE SUPERVISOR APPROVED
THE TRANSACTION, THE FIRM INSERTED ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE
LANGUAGE ON THE TRADE CONFIRMATION NOTIFYING THE CUSTOMER
THAT THE SWITCH COULD RESULT IN NEW SALES CHARGES. FURTHER,
CERTAIN UIT SWITCH TRANSACTIONS APPEARED ON THE FIRM'S MULTIPRODUCT SWITCH REPORT, A SURVEILLANCE REPORT THE FIRM ISSUED
TO SUPERVISORS AS A TOOL TO ASSIST WITH THE SUPERVISION OF SUCH
TRANSACTIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT, THE FIRM
EXCLUDED UIT ROLLOVERS FROM THE DEFINITION OF A "SWITCH" IN ITS
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. AS A RESULT, IF A REPRESENTATIVE
SELECTED "ROLLOVER" AS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR A UIT SWITCH IN THE
FIRM'S ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM, UIT ROLLOVERS WERE NOT ROUTED TO
SUPERVISORS FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL PRIOR TO EXECUTION. IN
ADDITION, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE DISCLOSURE LANGUAGE ON
TRADE CONFIRMATIONS FOR UIT ROLLOVERS. ALSO, BECAUSE THE FIRM
EXCLUDED UIT ROLLOVERS FROM THE DEFINITION OF A "SWITCH," UIT
ROLLOVERS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE APPEARED ON THE FIRM'S
MULTI-PRODUCT SWITCH REPORT WERE OMITTED FROM THE REPORT.
THEREFORE, THE FIRM HAD NO AUTOMATED MECHANISM TO DETECT
SHORT-TERM UIT ROLLOVERS. FINRA FOUND THAT HUNDREDS OF FIRM
REPRESENTATIVES EXECUTED SHORT-TERM UIT ROLLOVERS IN
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. IN JUNE 2015, THE FIRM
MODIFIED ITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO INCLUDE UIT ROLLOVERS
IN THE SWITCH DEFINITION, THEREBY MAKING UIT ROLLOVERS
EXECUTED MORE THAN 100 DAYS PRIOR TO MATURITY SUBJECT TO THE
FIRM'S SUPERVISORY REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS.

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (COMMISSION) DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN
THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 203(E) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
(ADVISERS ACT) AGAINST MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY, LLC. FROM
MID-2010 TO MID-2015, MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY, LLC (MSSB)
SOLICITED ADVISORY CLIENTS WITH OVER 600 NON-DISCRETIONARY
ADVISORY ACCOUNTS TO PURCHASE SINGLE-INVERSE EXCHANGETRADED FUNDS (ETFS), WITHOUT IMPLEMENTING MSSB'S WRITTEN
COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WHICH WERE DESIGNED TO
PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF THE OF THE ADVISERS ACT, INCLUDING ITS
ANTIFRAUD PROVISIONS.
MSSB'S COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WHICH WERE
ADOPTED IN MARCH 2010, HAD TWO KEY REQUIREMENTS BEFORE
ADVISORY CLIENTS WITH NON-DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNTS PURCHASED
SINGLE-INVERSE ETFS: (1) EACH CLIENT WAS TO SIGN A CLIENT

WITH INVESTING IN THESE SECURITIES AND THE CLIENT DISCLOSURE
NOTICE WAS TO BE MAINTAINED; AND (2) A MSSB SUPERVISOR WAS TO
CONDUCT RISK REVIEWS TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF THESE
INVESTMENTS FOR THAT ADVISORY CLIENT. FOR ABOUT 44% OF THE
APPROXIMATELY 1,400 NON-DISCRETIONARY ADVISORY ACCOUNTS THAT
PURCHASED SINGLE-INVERSE ETFS ON A SOLICITED BASIS, A CLIENT
DISCLOSURE NOTICE WAS NOT SIGNED BY THE CLIENT PRIOR TO THE
PURCHASE OF SINGLE-INVERSE ETFS. IN ADDITION, FOR CLIENTS WHOSE
PURCHASES OF A SINGLE-INVERSE ETF WERE EXECUTED WITHOUT
OBTAINING A SIGNED CLIENT DISCLOSURE NOTICE, THE RISK REVIEWS
WERE EITHER DEFICIENT OR NOT CONDUCTED. MSSB ALSO FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT OTHER OF ITS COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
FOR NON-DISCRETIONARY ADVISORY CLIENTS INVESTING IN THESE
SECURITIES, INCLUDING THAT THE POSITIONS BE MONITORED ON AN
ONGOING BASIS, THAT THE PURCHASE OF SINGLE-INVERSE ETFS BE A
HEDGE, AND THAT FINANCIAL ADVISORS COMPLETE SINGLE-INVERSE ETF
TRAINING. MANY OF MSSB'S NON-DISCRETIONARY ADVISORY CLIENTS
HELD THE SECURITIES FOR MONTHS OR YEARS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT
THE CLIENT DISCLOSURE NOTICE STATED THAT SINGLE-INVERSE ETFS
ARE TYPICALLY UNSUITABLE FOR INVESTORS WHO PLAN TO HOLD THEM
FOR LONGER THAN ONE TRADING SESSION UNLESS USED AS PART OF A
TRADING OR HEDGING STRATEGY. MSSB SOLICITED SOME OF THESE
CLIENTS TO PURCHASE SINGLE-INVERSE ETFS IN RETIREMENT
ACCOUNTS WITH LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS. MANY OF THE CLIENTS
EXPERIENCED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR INVESTMENTS IN THE
SINGLE-INVERSE ETFS. MSSB KNEW THE SOLICITATION OF THESE
SECURITIES WAS A CONCERN FOR REGULATORS. IN 2010, MSSB ADOPTED
COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR NON-TRADITIONAL ETFS
TO MEET INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND BROKER-DEALER REQUIREMENTS.
NEVERTHELESS, MSSB WAS AWARE OF WEAKNESSES AND DEFICIENCIES
IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES. FOR EXAMPLE, A 2010 EXAM CONDUCTED BY THE SEC'S
OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS AND EXAMINATIONS (OCIE)
IDENTIFIED WEAKNESSES WITH MSSB'S DOCUMENTATION OF RISK
REVIEWS AND ITS MONITORING OF THE HEDGING REQUIREMENT, YET
MSSB FAILED TO TAKE SUFFICIENT CORRECTIVE MEASURES. MSSB'S
INTERNAL TESTING FROM 2012 TO 2014 ALSO SHOWED COMPLIANCE
DEFICIENCIES WITH NON-DISCRETIONARY ADVISORY ACCOUNTS IN AT
LEAST 12 OFFICES. IN ADDITION, AN MSSB 2013 INTERNAL AUDIT REPORT
NOTED INADEQUATE MONITORING OF MSSB'S IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS
SINGLE-INVERSE ETF POLICY. ACCORDINGLY, MSSB FAILED TO
ADEQUATELY IMPLEMENT ITS COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES,
WHICH WERE DESIGNED TO PREVENT UNSUITABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
OF SINGLE-INVERSE ETFS FOR ADVISORY CLIENTS WITH NONDISCRETIONARY ADVISORY ACCOUNTS. MSSB'S FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY

APPROPRIATE THAT CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY

1933 AGAINST MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY LLC (THE "FIRM"). IN
ANTICIPATION OF THE INSTITUTION OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, THE FIRM
HAS SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT WHICH THE COMMISSION
HAS DETERMINED TO ACCEPT. SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE

EXCEPT AS TO THE COMMISSION'S JURISDICTION OVER IT AND THE

RESPONDENT CONSENTS TO THE ENTRY OF THIS ORDER INSTITUTING
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER. ON THE BASIS OF THIS ORDER AND RESPONDENT'S
OFFER, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THIS PROCEEDING RELATES TO A
FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY A COMPANY
(THE "COMPANY")THAT WAS SOLD THROUGH CERTAIN FIRM FINANCIAL
ADVISORS BETWEEN AUGUST 2010 AND JULY 2011. FIFTEEN INVESTORS
(THE "RELEVANT INVESTORS")-EACH OF WHOM ALSO HAD A PRE-EXISTING
RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THREE FIRM FINANCIAL ADVISORS AS A
BROKERAGE CUSTOMER, ADVISORY CLIENT, OR BOTH-INVESTED IN THE
TRADING PROGRAM FOLLOWING PITCHES THAT WERE BASED ON THE
TRADING PROGRAM'S PAST PERFORMANCE AND RISK METRICS. THE
PITCHES WERE MADE ORALLY AND USED WRITTEN MATERIALS
PREPARED BY THE COMPANY. THE WRITTEN MATERIALS, HOWEVER,
WERE RENDERED MATERIALLY MISLEADING BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO
ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE THAT THE RELEVANT INVESTORS COULD BE
PLACED INTO THE PROGRAM USING SUBSTANTIALLY MORE LEVERAGE
THAN WAS DISCLOSED AND THAT MARK-UPS WOULD BE CHARGED ON
EACH TRADE. THE ORAL PRESENTATIONS MADE TO THE RELEVANT
INVESTORS CONTAINED THESE SAME OMISSIONS. WHEN THE COMPANY
TRADING MODELS BEGAN GENERATING LOSSES, THE RELEVANT
INVESTORS SUFFERED LOSSES THAT WERE INCREASED BY THE AMOUNT
OF LEVERAGE USED AND THE UNDISCLOSED MARK-UPS. AS A RESULT OF
THIS CONDUCT, THE FIRM VIOLATED SECTION 17(A)(2) OF THE
SECURITIES ACT.

("CITI SMITH BARNEY") OF CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS, INC. ("CGMI"), A
SUBSIDIARY OF CITIGROUP INC. BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 2002 AND

OVERCHARGED MORE THAN 149,000 ADVISORY CLIENT ACCOUNTS A
TOTAL OF $16,169,215 IN ADVISORY FEES DUE PRIMARILY TO CODING AND
OTHER ERRORS IN ITS BILLING SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES. THERE ARE
36 DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF ERRORS RESULTING IN OVERCHARGES.
SIX OF THE ERROR CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 58 PERCENT OF
THE FEES OVERBILLED, ORIGINATED WITH CITI SMITH BARNEY AND 30
ORIGINATED WITH MORGAN STANLEY OR MSSB. MSSB ALSO VIOLATED
THE CUSTODY RULE UNDER THE ADVISERS ACT AS IT RELATES TO THE
ANNUAL SURPRISE CUSTODY EXAMINATION. FURTHER, MSSB VIOLATED
THE BOOKS AND RECORDS PROVISIONS OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND
RULES THEREUNDER WITH RESPECT TO MAINTENANCE OF CLIENT
CONTRACTS. FINALLY, MSSB FAILED TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT
REASONABLY DESIGNED COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO
PREVENT THESE VIOLATIONS OF THE ADVISERS ACT.
GENERALLY, MSSB INADVERTENTLY OVERCHARGED FEES TO LEGACY
CITI SMITH BARNEY ADVISORY ACCOUNTS. FROM 2009 THROUGH 2015,
FOR 15,152 ADVISORY CLIENT ACCOUNTS, MSSB INADVERTENTLY

Allegations:

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
DELIVER TO CUSTOMERS APPROXIMATELY 2.1 MILLION PROSPECTUSES
AND FAILED TO IMPLEMENT A REASONABLE SUPERVISORY SYSTEM
ENSURING DELIVERY OF PROSPECTUSES. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT
THE FIRM MADE REQUIRED PROSPECTUSES AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS
THROUGH AN ONLINE PLATFORM IF THE CUSTOMER ELECTED TO
RECEIVE PAPERLESS TRANSACTION CONFIRMATIONS VIA ONLINE
DELIVERY. AFTER DEPLOYMENT OF A SYSTEM UPDATE TO CHANGE
VARIOUS FEATURES OF THE ONLINE PLATFORM IN NOVEMBER 2013, THE
FIRM DID NOT TEST A HYPERLINK TO THE PROSPECTUS TO ENSURE THAT
THEY REMAINED AVAILABLE TO ONLINE CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT OF THE
SYSTEM UPDATE, THE HYPERLINK WAS NOT PLACED ON THE ONLINE
TRANSACTION CONFIRMATION DURING A NINE MONTH PERIOD. THE
FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO DELIVER INVESTMENT
OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS IF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGES
WERE NOT APPROVED ON THE SAME DAY REQUESTED AND FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT A REASONABLE SUPERVISORY SYSTEM TO ENSURE THEIR
DELIVERY. THE FIRM EMPLOYED AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO ENSURE

TRANSACTION CONFIRMATION DURING A NINE MONTH PERIOD. THE
FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO DELIVER INVESTMENT
OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS IF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGES
WERE NOT APPROVED ON THE SAME DAY REQUESTED AND FAILED TO
IMPLEMENT A REASONABLE SUPERVISORY SYSTEM TO ENSURE THEIR
DELIVERY. THE FIRM EMPLOYED AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO ENSURE
THAT INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS WERE DELIVERED.
DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE FIRM MADE A SYSTEM
CHANGE THAT RESULTED IN FAILURES IN DELIVERING INVESTMENT
OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. DUE TO
A CODING ERROR IN THE SYSTEM CHANGE, WHEN A SUPERVISOR
APPROVED AN INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGE ON A DAY OTHER THAN
THE SAME DAY THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR ENTERED THE CHANGE FOR THE
CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT, THE SYSTEM DID NOT GENERATE AND SEND A
CONFIRMATION LETTER. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM'S SYSTEM FAILED TO
GENERATE AND SEND APPROXIMATELY 23,500 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
CHANGE LETTERS TO CUSTOMERS. IN MOST CASES, THE FIRM
REFLECTED INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES ON CUSTOMERS' MONTHLY
ACCOUNT STATEMENTS. FOR CUSTOMERS THAT OPTED NOT TO RECEIVE
MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENTS, THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
CHANGES WERE NOT CONFIRMED TO CUSTOMERS IN A TIMELY MANNER.
SEPARATELY, IF AN INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGE WAS ENTERED BUT
NOT APPROVED WITHIN 29 DAYS, THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY
REJECTED THE PROPOSED CHANGE. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE, A
CUSTOMER'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WOULD NOT BE CHANGED AND NO
INVESTMENT CHANGE CONFIRMATION LETTER WAS SENT. WHERE THE
PROPOSED CHANGE WAS AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED, THE FIRM DID NOT
HAVE AN ADEQUATE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM THAT BROUGHT THE AUTO
REJECTED CHANGE TO A SUPERVISOR'S OR FINANCIAL ADVISOR'S
ATTENTION FOR REVIEW AND ACTION TO DETERMINE IF THE CHANGE
WAS REJECTED IN ERROR. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM
FAILED TO SEND INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS AS A RESULT
OF A CODING ERROR RELATED TO ACCOUNT NUMBER CHANGES. IN THE
PERIOD BETWEEN AT LEAST JUNE 2012 AND JUNE 2016, THE FIRM FAILED
TO SEND AT LEAST 4,000 LETTERS TO CUSTOMERS CONFIRMING
CHANGES IN THEIR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE
CHANGE. DUE TO THE SYSTEM CODING ERROR, THE FIRM SYSTEM
INCORRECTLY VIEWED ACCOUNTS UNDERGOING ACCOUNT NUMBER
CHANGES AS CLOSED AND THUS SUPPRESSED THE TRANSMITTAL OF THE
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS. WHILE THE FIRM'S SYSTEMS
CONTAINED THE UPDATED INFORMATION, IT DID NOT CONFIRM
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGES THROUGH THE CONFIRMATION
LETTERS IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE SENT. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM
FAILED TO ENSURE THAT IT MET ITS OBLIGATIONS TO CONFIRM
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGES. BY REASON OF THE FOREGOING,
THE FIRM FAILED TO REASONABLY ENFORCE ITS SUPERVISORY SYSTEM
AND, AS A RESULT, FAILED TO SEND AND RETAIN THE REQUIRED
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGE LETTERS.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT REPORTED
POSITIONS TO THE LARGE OPTIONS POSITIONS REPORT SYSTEM (LOPR)
WITHOUT THE REQUISITE IN-CONCERT IDENTIFICATION DUE TO THE
DUPLICATION OF TWO REQUIRED DATA FIELDS (REFERENCE ID AND
REGISTRATION ID) FOR IN-CONCERT SUBMISSIONS. UNBEKNOWNST TO
THE FIRM, THE DUPLICATED DATA HAD CAUSED REJECTIONS OF CERTAIN
OF ITS IN-CONCERT REPORTS, AND THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO REVIEW AND
RE-SUBMIT THE REJECTED IN-CONCERT SUBMISSIONS TO THE OPTIONS
CLEARING CORPORATION (OCC) CAUSED POSITIONS REPORTED TO NOT
BE IDENTIFIED AS ACTING IN-CONCERT. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE
FIRM FAILED TO ACCURATELY OR COMPLETELY REPORT POSITIONS TO
THE LOPR AS FOLLOWS: THE FIRM REPORTED POSITIONS FOR
DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN ACCOUNTS TO THE LOPR WITHOUT TAX
IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (TINS) OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS (SSNS),
INCLUDING DOMESTIC ACCOUNTS; THE FIRM REPORTED POSITIONS TO
THE LOPR IN THE WRONG ACCOUNT TYPE, IN THAT THE FIRM REPORTED
"CUSTOMER" POSITIONS WITH AN INACCURATE ACCOUNT TYPE OF
"FIRM"; THE FIRM REPORTED POSITIONS TO THE LOPR WITH ACCOUNT
NAMES EXTENDING INTO THE ADDRESS FIELD, WITH INCOMPLETE
ADDRESS FIELDS, OR WITH STREET ADDRESSES THAT INCLUDED
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION; AND THE FIRM REPORTED POSITIONS TO THE
LOPR WITHOUT A ZIP CODE. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM
ALSO FAILED TO REPORT, OR ACCURATELY REPORT, REPORTABLE
OPTIONS POSITIONS TO THE LOPR AS FOLLOWS: THE FIRM FAILED TO
CAPTURE FOR IN-CONCERT REPORTING CERTAIN JOINT AND
PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNTS, ACCOUNTS WITH A STATUS OF CLOSED OR
"SWUNG" (CLIENT ACCOUNT TRANSFERRED TO NEW ACCOUNT NUMBER),
CERTAIN FOREIGN ACCOUNTS, CERTAIN FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND
PORTFOLIO MANAGER ACCOUNTS, AND ACCOUNTS WITH THIRD-PARTY
TRADING AUTHORITY OVER NON-DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNTS; THE FIRM
FAILED TO INCLUDE FLEX OPTIONS IN ITS LOPR AGGREGATION; THE FIRM
FAILED TO INCLUDE OPTIONS MARKED AS INACTIVE IN ITS LOPR POSITION
FILE; AND THE FIRM INCORRECTLY POPULATED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
OPTIONS POSITIONS WITH THE SUBMISSION DATE RATHER THAN THE

OF FOLLOW-UP AND REVIEW, REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES GOVERNING THE REPORTING OF
POSITIONS TO THE LOPR. FINRA FOUND THAT THE FIRM ALSO LACKED

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE BY FOLLOWING FIRM POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES TO DETECT AND CAUSE THE REPORTING OF POTENTIALLY
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT SPECIFICALLY,
A CLIENT OF THE FIRM, AT ITS BRANCH IN ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA,
WAS ABLE TO KITE CHECKS BETWEEN HIS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
ACCOUNT MAINTAINED AT THE BRANCH AND A SEPARATE BANK ACCOUNT
MAINTAINED AT A LOCAL BANK, IN FURTHERANCE OF A FRAUDULENT
"PONZI" SCHEME, DESPITE HIS ACTIVITY RAISING RED FLAGS IDENTIFIED
IN FIRM POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AS BEING INDICATIVE OF
POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT
THE CLIENT REPRESENTED TO THE FIRM THAT HIS BUSINESS MODEL WAS
TO FACILITATE "LIKE KIND" REAL ESTATE EXCHANGES PURSUANT TO
SECTION 1031 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE CLIENT ALSO
PARTICIPATED IN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS
WITH HIS INVESTORS. HOWEVER, IN FACT, THE CLIENT DID NOT INVEST
THE MONEY AS REPRESENTED TO HIS INVESTORS. INSTEAD, THE CLIENT
HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A FRAUDULENT "PONZI" SCHEME THAT HE KEPT
AFLOAT IN PART BY MOVING MONEY BETWEEN THE FIRM'S ACCOUNT AND
THE LOCAL BANK'S ACCOUNT. FROM 2001 TO 2008, THE FIRM'S ACCOUNT
HAD ABOUT $10.7 MILLION IN TOTAL DEPOSITS AND ABOUT $10.2 MILLION
IN TOTAL WITHDRAWALS. BY CONTRAST, IN 2009 AND 2010, THE FIRM'S
ACCOUNT HAD ABOUT $429 MILLION IN TOTAL DEPOSITS AND ABOUT $424
MILLION IN TOTAL WITHDRAWALS. FURTHER, DURING THIS PERIOD OF
INCREASED DEPOSIT AND WITHDRAWAL ACTIVITY, THE FIRM'S ACCOUNT
HAD ALMOST NO SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. INSTEAD, THE ACCOUNT
WAS USED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO TRANSFER FUNDS BETWEEN THE
FIRM'S ACCOUNT AND THE LOCAL BANK'S ACCOUNT. IN FACT, THE CLIENT
WAS KITING CHECKS. THE CLIENT WOULD DEPOSIT CHECKS FROM THE
BANK'S ACCOUNT INTO THE FIRM'S ACCOUNT AND, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,
WRITE A CHECK FROM THE FIRM'S ACCOUNT BACK TO THE BANK'S
ACCOUNT. THE FIRM PERMITTED THE CLIENT TO WRITE CHECKS AGAINST
UN-CLEARED FUNDS. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE ACTIVITY
IN THE FIRM'S ACCOUNT TRIGGERED RED FLAGS INDICATIVE OF
POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY THAT WERE, APPROPRIATELY,
IDENTIFIED IN ITS WRITTEN AML POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE
ISSUED TO FIRM EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2009
AND DECEMBER 2010, THE FIRM'S ELECTRONIC ALERT SYSTEM
GENERATED ALERTS AS A RESULT OF THE RAPID MOVEMENT OF FUNDS
THROUGH THE FIRM'S ACCOUNT. AS A RESULT OF THESE ALERTS, THE
FIRM REVIEWED THE CLIENT RELATIONSHIP IN LATE 2009 AND MET WITH
THE CLIENT IN EARLY 2010. THE ASHEVILLE BRANCH RECEIVED WHAT IT

HOWEVER, THE ALERTS AND THE RED FLAGS INDICATIVE OF

IN AUGUST 2010, AS A RESULT OF THESE ALERTS, BRANCH AND COMPLEX
MANAGEMENT AGAIN REVIEWED THE ACTIVITY IN THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT
WITH THE FIRM. AS A RESULT OF THIS REVIEW, IN NOVEMBER 2010 THE
FIRM CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER PAY THE CLIENT'S
CHECKS ON UN-CLEARED FUNDS AND ADVISED THE CLIENT. THE CLIENT'S
PONZI SCHEME THEN COLLAPSED WHEN HE BOUNCED SEVERAL
CHECKS.

SEC ADMIN RELEASE 34-78021, IA RELEASE 40-4415, JUNE 8, 2016:
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE "COMMISSION")
DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE "EXCHANGE ACT"), AND
SECTIONS 203(E) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
(THE "ADVISERS ACT"), AGAINST MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY LLC
("MSSB" OR "RESPONDENT").
THE PROCEEDING ARISES OUT OF MSSB'S FAILURE TO ADOPT WRITTEN
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT
CUSTOMER RECORDS AND INFORMATION, IN VIOLATION OF RULE 30(A) OF
REGULATION S-P (17 C.F.R. § 248.30(A)) (THE "SAFEGUARDS RULE"). FROM
AT LEAST AUGUST 2001 THROUGH DECEMBER 2014, MSSB STORED
SENSITIVE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") OF
INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM MSSB PROVIDED BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT
ADVISORY SERVICES (REFERRED TO HEREIN AS "CUSTOMERS") ON TWO
OF THE FIRM'S APPLICATIONS: THE BUSINESS INFORMATION SYSTEM
("BIS") PORTAL AND THE FIXED INCOME DIVISION SELECT ("FID SELECT")
PORTAL (COLLECTIVELY, "THE PORTALS"). AN MSSB EMPLOYEE,
MISAPPROPRIATED DATA REGARDING APPROXIMATELY 730,000
CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS, ASSOCIATED WITH APPROXIMATELY 330,000
DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS, BY ACCESSING THE PORTALS BETWEEN 2011
AND 2014. THE MISAPPROPRIATED DATA INCLUDED PII, SUCH AS
CUSTOMERS' FULL NAMES, PHONE NUMBERS, STREET ADDRESSES,
ACCOUNT NUMBERS, ACCOUNT BALANCES AND SECURITIES HOLDINGS.
BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY DECEMBER 15, 2014 AND FEBRUARY 3, 2015,
PORTIONS OF THIS STOLEN DATA WERE POSTED TO AT LEAST THREE
INTERNET SITES ALONG WITH AN OFFER TO SELL A LARGER QUANTITY OF
STOLEN DATA IN EXCHANGE FOR PAYMENT IN SPEEDCOINS, A DIGITAL
CURRENCY. MSSB DISCOVERED THE DATA BREACH THROUGH ONE OF ITS
ROUTINE INTERNET SWEEPS ON DECEMBER 27, 2014. AFTER COMPARING
CERTAIN DATA REPORTS GENERATED BY THE EMPLOYEE TO THE
INFORMATION POSTED ON THE INTERNET, MSSB IDENTIFIED THE
EMPLOYEE AS THE LIKELY SOURCE OF THE DATA BREACH. ON DECEMBER
29 AND 30, 2014, MSSB INTERVIEWED THE EMPLOYEE, WHO
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD ACCESSED AND DOWNLOADED
CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER DATA TO HIS OWN DATA STORAGE DEVICE
(HEREAFTER, "PERSONAL SERVER"). THE EMPLOYEE DENIED POSTING
ANY OF THE DATA ON THE INTERNET. SUBSEQUENT FORENSIC ANALYSIS
OF THE EMPLOYEE'S PERSONAL SERVER REVEALED THAT A THIRD PARTY
LIKELY HACKED INTO THE PERSONAL SERVER AND COPIED THE
CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER DATA THAT THE EMPLOYEE HAD
DOWNLOADED FROM THE PORTALS.
THE SAFEGUARDS RULE, WHICH THE COMMISSION ADOPTED IN 2000 AND
AMENDED IN 2005, REQUIRES, AMONG OTHERS, EVERY BROKER-DEALER

ADOPT WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED

THE SAFEGUARDS RULE, WHICH THE COMMISSION ADOPTED IN 2000 AND
AMENDED IN 2005, REQUIRES, AMONG OTHERS, EVERY BROKER-DEALER
AND INVESTMENT ADVISER REGISTERED WITH THE COMMISSION TO
ADOPT WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED
TO: (1) INSURE THE SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF CUSTOMER
RECORDS AND INFORMATION; (2) PROTECT AGAINST ANY ANTICIPATED
THREATS OR HAZARDS TO THE SECURITY OR INTEGRITY OF CUSTOMER
RECORDS AND INFORMATION; AND (3) PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED
ACCESS TO OR USE OF CUSTOMER RECORDS OR INFORMATION THAT
COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL HARM OR INCONVENIENCE TO ANY
CUSTOMER. MSSB VIOLATED THE SAFEGUARDS RULE BECAUSE ITS
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
MEET THESE OBJECTIVES BY FAILING TO INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE:
REASONABLY DESIGNED AND OPERATING AUTHORIZATION MODULES FOR
THE PORTALS THAT RESTRICTED EMPLOYEE ACCESS TO ONLY THE
CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER DATA AS TO WHICH SUCH EMPLOYEES HAD A
LEGITIMATE BUSINESS NEED; AUDITING AND/OR TESTING OF THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH AUTHORIZATION MODULES; AND MONITORING
AND ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYEE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE PORTALS.
MSSB WILLFULLY VIOLATED RULE 30(A) OF REGULATION S-P (17 C.F.R. §
248.30(A)), WHICH REQUIRES EVERY BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT
ADVISER REGISTERED WITH THE COMMISSION TO ADOPT WRITTEN
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
SAFEGUARD CUSTOMER RECORDS AND INFORMATION.

PROVIDER'S CODING AND ACCEPTANCE OF MONEY ORDERS WHICH
WERE DEPOSITED INTO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. AS A RESULT, THREE OF
THE FIRM'S REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES IN TWO DIFFERENT BRANCH
OFFICES WERE ABLE TO CONVERT, COLLECTIVELY, $494,400 FROM
THIRTEEN CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM THROUGH FRAUDULENT WIRE
TRANSFERS AND BRANCH CHECKS SENT FROM THE CUSTOMERS'
ACCOUNTS TO THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE FIRM
HAD NO SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS OR WRITTEN PROCEDURES TO DETECT
AND MONITOR THE DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS FROM UNRELATED
CUSTOMERS' ACCOUNTS TO A COMMON THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNT. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE FIRM'S SYSTEMS DID NOT INCLUDE ANY EXCEPTION
REPORTS THAT WOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE CUSTOMER WIRE
TRANSFERS GOING TO THE SAME THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNT. ALSO, THE
FIRM'S SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AND WRITTEN PROCEDURES DID NOT
ADDRESS THE COMPARING OF CUSTOMERS' SIGNATURES ON OUTGOING
WIRE TRANSFER REQUEST FORMS WITH SIGNATURES ON FILE.
HOWEVER, THEREAFTER, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES
REQUIRING SUPERVISORS TO COMPARE AND AUTHENTICATE CUSTOMER
SIGNATURES ON CERTAIN OUTGOING WIRE TRANSFER REQUEST FORMS
FOR WIRE TRANSFER REQUESTS GREATER THAN $100,000. AFTER
DISCOVERING THE MISCONDUCT, THE FIRM REPAID THE AFFECTED
CUSTOMERS. ALSO, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED A REPORT TO DETECT WIRE
TRANSFERS FROM UNRELATED CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS TO A COMMON
THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNT. THE FIRM TERMINATED THE REPRESENTATIVES
AND THEY WERE BARRED BY FINRA.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED

EXECUTED LONG SALE TRANSACTIONS IN NMS SECURITIES AND
REPORTED EACH OF THESE TRANSACTIONS TO FINRA WITH A SHORT
EXEMPT MODIFIER IN RELIANCE UPON PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN SEC
REGULATION SHO RULE 201(D), WHEN SUCH PROVISIONS WERE NOT
APPLICABLE. THE FIRM EXECUTED SHORT SALE TRANSACTIONS IN OTC
EQUITY SECURITIES AND INCORRECTLY REPORTED EACH OF THESE
TRANSACTIONS TO FINRA WITH A SHORT EXEMPT MODIFIER. THE
FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM EXECUTED SHORT SALE ORDERS AND
IMPROPERLY MARKED THE ORDERS AS SHORT EXEMPT. THE FINDINGS
ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN AND
ENFORCE WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY
DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT ORDERS MARKED AS SHORT EXEMPT
COMPLIED WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SEC RULE 201(C) OF REGULATION
SHO. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO REPORT
THE CORRECT TIME OF TRADE EXECUTION TO THE REAL-TIME
TRANSACTION REPORTING SYSTEM (RTRS) IN REPORTS OF
TRANSACTIONS IN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES AND FAILED TO SHOW THE
CORRECT TIME OF TRADE EXECUTION ON THE MEMORANDUM. THE FIRM
ALSO FAILED TO REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF THESE SAME
TRANSACTIONS WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF TIME OF TRADE TO AN RTRS
PORTAL. FINRA FOUND THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO REPORT TO THE TRADE
REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE ENGINE (TRACE) THE CORRECT TIME OF
TRADE EXECUTION FOR TRANSACTIONS IN TRACE-ELIGIBLE SECURITIZED
PRODUCTS AND FAILED TO SHOW THE CORRECT TIME OF TRADE
EXECUTION ON THE MEMORANDUM FOR THESE SAME BROKERAGE
ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FINRA DETERMINED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO
REPORT TO TRACE TRANSACTIONS IN TRACE-ELIGIBLE AGENCY BONDS
WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF THE TIME OF EXECUTION. MOREOVER, FINRA
FOUND THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO REPORT THE CORRECT MARKET
IDENTIFIER FOR S1 AND P1 TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING AGENCY BONDS.
FURTHERMORE, FINRA FOUND THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO REPORT TO
TRACE LARGE BLOCK S1 TRANSACTIONS IN CORPORATE AND AGENCY
BONDS WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF THE TIME OF EXECUTION. THE FINDINGS
ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO REPORT TO TRACE
TRANSACTIONS IN TRACE-ELIGIBLE SECURITIZED PRODUCTS WITHIN THE

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO
HAVE ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS SHORT
POSITIONS IN TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL BONDS THAT RESULTED PRIMARILY
FROM TRADING ERRORS AT THE FIRM'S RETAIL BRANCHES. AS A RESULT
OF THESE SUPERVISORY FAILURES, THE FIRM INACCURATELY
REPRESENTED TO AT LEAST 1,500 CUSTOMERS THAT AT LEAST $880,000
IN INTEREST THAT THE FIRM PAID TO THOSE CUSTOMERS WAS EXEMPT
FROM TAXATION. IN FACT, THE FIRM DID NOT HOLD THE BONDS ON
BEHALF OF THE CUSTOMERS AND THE INTEREST THAT THE CUSTOMERS
RECEIVED WAS PAID BY THE FIRM AND THUS TAXABLE AS ORDINARY
INCOME. THIS RESULTED IN THE UNDERPAYMENT OF AT LEAST $358,000 IN
FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. AT ONE POINT, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED THAT
SHORT POSITIONS WERE NOT BEING COVERED IN A TIMELY FASHION.
HOWEVER, THE FIRM DID NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE GUIDANCE OR
OVERSIGHT ON HOW AND WHEN THE MUNICIPAL SHORT POSITIONS
SHOULD BE COVERED. THIS DEFICIENCY WAS MAGNIFIED BECAUSE OF
THE DIFFICULTY OF COVERING THESE POSITIONS IN LIGHT OF THE
MARKET STRUCTURE AND ILLIQUIDITY OF MUNICIPAL BONDS. THUS, THE
FIRM OFTEN DID NOT COVER MUNICIPAL SHORT POSITIONS FOR A MONTH
OR MORE, AND SOME OF THE SHORT POSITIONS WERE NOT COVERED
FOR YEARS. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO
REASONABLY SUPERVISE, IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE WRITTEN
PROCEDURES, OR MAINTAIN A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM THAT WAS
REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH MSRB RULES
WHEN THE FIRM MAINTAINED SHORT POSITIONS IN MUNICIPAL
SECURITIES AND PAID TAXABLE SUBSTITUTE INTEREST TO ITS
CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM MISCHARACTERIZED AT LEAST
$880,000 IN INTEREST THAT THE FIRM HAD PAID TO ITS CUSTOMERS AS
EXEMPT FROM TAXATION. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM
MISSTATED TO AT LEAST 1,500 CUSTOMERS THAT THE INTEREST THE
CUSTOMERS WERE RECEIVING WAS TAX EXEMPT, AND ALSO FAILED TO
DISCLOSE THAT THE INTEREST THEY WERE RECEIVING WAS NOT
ENTITLED TO TAX EXEMPT STATUS. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT
THE FIRM SENT ACCOUNT STATEMENTS TO APPROXIMATELY 1,500
CUSTOMERS THAT INACCURATELY STATED THAT THE CUSTOMERS WERE
RECEIVING TAX-EXEMPT INCOME AND THEREBY FAILED AS A MUNICIPAL
DEALER TO MAKE AND KEEP CURRENT CERTAIN BOOKS AND RECORDS,
INCLUDING ACCOUNT STATEMENTS THAT THEY CHOOSE TO SEND TO
THEIR CUSTOMERS.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED
TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT THE FIRM
FAILED TO ENFORCE ITS WRITTEN PROCEDURES, RESULTING IN A
WIDESPREAD FAILURE TO CREATE OR MAINTAIN CERTAIN REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS (I.E., CERTIFICATIONS FROM RETIRED REPRESENTATIVES,
INITIAL AND ANNUAL LETTERS TO CLIENTS). THE FINDINGS STATED THAT
THE FIRM PAID, UNDER ITS FORMER FINANCIAL ADVISOR PROGRAM
(FFAP) AND PREDECESSOR PROGRAMS, MORE THAN $100 MILLION IN
COMMISSIONS TO FORMER REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAD
RETIRED. AT THE TIME OF THESE PAYMENTS, MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS
WERE NOT REGISTERED OR ASSOCIATED WITH A REGISTERED FIRM. THE
PAYMENTS WERE MADE UNDER A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED PAYMENTS
TO UNREGISTERED, RETIRED REPRESENTATIVES IN COMPLIANCE WITH A
NO-ACTION LETTER ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION IN NOVEMBER 2008. THE LETTER INDICATED THAT THE SEC
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNDER SECTION

CERTAIN CONDITIONS BEFORE AND DURING THE PAYMENT OF

FIRM'S FAILURE TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PROCEDURES - AND ITS FAILURE
TO DETECT PROMPTLY ITS NON-COMPLIANCE - LED TO THE WIDESPREAD
FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN
THE SEC'S ISSUED 2008 NO-ACTION LETTER. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED
THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO CREATE OR MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED RETIRED
REPRESENTATIVE CERTIFICATIONS OR CUSTOMER LETTERS FOR A
SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THE RETIRED REPRESENTATIVES TO
WHOM IT PAID CONTINUING COMMISSIONS. THE CERTIFICATIONS AND
LETTERS THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO CREATE OR MAINTAIN WERE
NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THE 2008 NO-ACTION
LETTER. THEY ALSO WERE NECESSARY TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO DETECT
WHETHER THE RETIRED REPRESENTATIVES WERE ACTING AS
UNREGISTERED BROKERS IN VIOLATION OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
SECTION 15(A)(1) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRM'S
FAILURE TO ENFORCE ITS PROCEDURES, IT PAID THE COMMISSIONS TO
THE RETIRED REPRESENTATIVES, MANY OF WHOM WERE NOT
REGISTERED, WITHOUT ADHERING TO THE TERMS OF THE NO-ACTION
LETTER. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO
DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE PAYMENTS WERE BEING MADE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 15(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND NASD

TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT THE IT BEGAN

HALF, WITH REGARD TO INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS (IPOS), CERTAIN
OFFICES OF THE FIRM OPERATED UNDER LEGACY POLICIES OF AN
ENTITY FROM THE MERGER, WHILE OTHERS OPERATED UNDER LEGACY
PROCEDURES OF THE OTHER ENTITY FROM THE MERGER. THE FINDINGS
STATED THAT THE TWO LEGACY POLICIES OFFERED DIFFERENT
GUIDANCE REGARDING THE SOLICITATION OF OFFERS IN IPOS. ONE
LEGACY POLICY DIRECTED FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO OBTAIN AND
RECONFIRM INDICATIONS OF INTEREST FROM CUSTOMERS, WHILE THE
OTHER LEGACY POLICY DIRECTED FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO SOLICIT
CONDITIONAL OFFERS TO BUY SECURITIES FROM INVESTORS. BOTH
LEGACY POLICIES PROHIBITED UNAUTHORIZED TRADING.
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FIRM ISSUED A COMPLIANCE NOTICE TO RECONCILE
THESE POLICIES. THE NEW POLICY, WHICH USED THE TERMS
"CONDITIONAL OFFER" AND "INDICATION OF INTEREST"
INTERCHANGEABLY, DIRECTED FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO ASCERTAIN THE
CUSTOMERS' INTEREST IN IPO SHARES AT A SPECIFIED PRICE RANGE.
CUSTOMERS WERE TO BE INFORMED THAT SHARES IN THE IPO WOULD
NOT BE GUARANTEED. NO RECONFIRMATION WOULD TAKE PLACE
UNLESS THE FINAL PRICE FELL OUTSIDE OF THE INDICATED RANGE. THE
POLICY DID NOT EXPLICITLY STATE THAT INVESTORS WOULD BE GIVEN AN
OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW AFTER REGISTRATION BECAME EFFECTIVE
BUT BEFORE ACCEPTANCE. OFFERS WERE NOT PLACED IN WRITING, BUT
WERE RECORDED AS "INDICATIONS OF INTEREST" IN THE FIRM'S ORDER
SYSTEM. THE FIRM DID NOT RECORD THE TERMS OF THE OFFER OTHER
THAN TO TRACK THE NUMBER OF SHARES REQUESTED IN THE FIRM'S
ORDER SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THE POLICY INITIATED WAS SUSPENDED,
AFTER A LITTLE OVER ONE YEAR, AND THEREAFTER THE FIRM HAS HAD
THE PRACTICE OF RECONFIRMING ALL CUSTOMER ORDERS AFTER THE
FINAL PRICING TERMS WERE AVAILABLE. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED
THAT THE FIRM POLICIES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING THE
SOLICITATION OF OFFERS IN IPOS IN EFFECT DURING THE RELEVANT
PERIOD WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE
WITH THE SECURITIES LAWS OR FINRA RULES: THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES FAILED TO ADEQUATELY DISTINGUISH CONDITIONAL
OFFERS FROM INDICATIONS OF INTEREST; THE FIRM FAILED TO PROVIDE
SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE AND TRAINING TO ITS SALE STAFF REGARDING
THE SOLICITATION OF CONDITIONAL OFFERS; AND THE FIRM FAILED TO
ADEQUATELY MONITOR THE SOLICITATION OF CONDITIONAL OFFERS TO
ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH ITS OWN POLICIES, OR THE SECURITIES
LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND FINRA RULES. THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES CONFLATED INDICATIONS OF INTEREST AND CONDITIONAL
OFFERS. THE FIRM FAILED TO MAKE ANY DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE
TWO TERMS IN ITS HARMONIZED POLICIES AND OFFERED NO TRAINING
OR OTHER MATERIALS TO ITS FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO CLARIFY THE
POLICY. AS A RESULT, SALES STAFF AND CUSTOMERS MAY NOT HAVE
PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT TYPE OF INTEREST WAS BEING
SOLICITED. THE FIRM ALSO FAILED TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR

APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT A PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING BE, AND HEREBY IS, INSTITUTED TO

FILING AND SIMULTANEOUS SETTLEMENT OF CHARGES AGAINST
MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY LLC, A REGISTERED FUTURES
COMMISSION MERCHANT (FCM), FOR VIOLATING CFTC RULES
GOVERNING SECURED FUNDS OF FOREIGN FUTURES AND OPTION

DILIGENTLY SUPERVISE ITS EMPLOYEES HANDLING OF MATTERS
RELATED TO ITS BUSINESS AS A CFTC REGISTRANT. NONE OF THE
VIOLATIONS RESULTED IN ANY CUSTOMER LOSSES, ACCORDING TO THE
CFTC'S ORDER. THE CFTC'S ORDER FINDS THAT ON THE FIRM

CUSTOMER SECURED FUNDS BANK ACCOUNT RESULTING IN A
DEFICIENCY IN THE FIRM'S SECURED FUNDS OF APPROXIMATELY $9.27
MILLION. THE FIRM DISCOVERED THE ERROR THE NEXT DAY AND CURED
THE DEFICIENCY. AFTER ITS SECURED DEFICIENCY, THE FIRM
INDEPENDENTLY ENGAGED A COMPANY TO REVIEW ITS POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO SEGREGATED AND SECURED
ACCOUNTS. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED A REPORT
RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES,
WHICH THE FIRM HAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. THE CFTC'S ORDER
ALSO FINDS THAT FOR APPROXIMATELY A SIX-MONTH PERIOD, THE FIRM
COMMINGLED CUSTOMER SEGREGATED AND FIRM FUNDS IN A
CUSTOMER SEGREGATED BANK ACCOUNT. IN ADDITION, FOR
APPROXIMATELY AN EIGHT-MONTH PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO
PREPARE ACCURATE DAILY COMPUTATIONS OF ITS SEGREGATED AND
SECURED FUNDS. NONE OF THE ERRORS CAUSED THE FIRM TO FALL
BELOW ITS REQUIRED SEGREGATED OR SECURED FUNDS; HOWEVER,
THE FIRM WAS REQUIRED TO REFILE 120 DAILY STATEMENTS AS A RESULT
OF THE ERRORS. FINALLY, THE CFTC'S ORDER FINDS THAT OVER
SEVERAL MONTHS, ACCOUNT STATEMENTS FOR FOUR FIRM
SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS WERE IMPROPERLY TITLED AS CUSTOMER
SECURED ACCOUNTS.

User Guidance

THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT RESPONDENT'S "CUSTOMER A"
PROVIDED TRUST SERVICES FOR ITS CLIENTS, AND IN THE COURSE OF
PROVIDING SUCH SERVICES TO ONE OF ITS CLIENTS, CUSTOMER A
ACCEPTED ORDERS TO TRADE COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACTS ON
BEHALF OF ITS OWN THIRD PARTY CLIENT, ACCEPTED THE THIRD PARTY
CLIENT'S MONEY TO PLACE THOSE TRADES, AND EFFECTED THE TRADES
VIA A CONTRACT MARKET ON THE THIRD PARTY CLIENT'S BEHALF. THESE
CONTRACTS WERE TRADED IN A PROPRIETARY FUTURES ACCOUNT IN
CUSTOMER A'S NAME CARRIED INITIALLY AT ANOTHER REGISTERED
FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT ("FCM") AND LATER IN AN ACCOUNT
CARRIED BY RESPONDENT. RESPONDENT WAS CREATED AS A JOINT
VENTURE INCLUDING ASSETS CONTRIBUTED BY THE OTHER FCM IN 2009.
BY ACCEPTING THE ORDERS TO PURCHASE A COMMODITY FOR FUTURE
DELIVERY ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD PARTY CLIENT SUBJECT TO THE
RULES OF A CONTRACT MARKET, AND ACCEPTING THE THIRD PARTY
CLIENT'S MONEY TO SECURE THOSE TRADES, CUSTOMER A ACTED AS AN
FCM WITHOUT BEING REGISTERED AS SUCH, IN VIOLATION OF THE ACT.
FROM 2006 TO 2008, CUSTOMER A CONDUCTED FIVE TRANSFERS OF
FUNDS FROM ITS PROPRIETARY COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING
ACCOUNT. THESE TRANSACTIONS CLEARLY SHOWED FUNDS MOVING
FROM CUSTOMER A'S PROPRIETARY FUTURES TRADING ACCOUNT TO A
THIRD PARTY CLIENT'S BANK ACCOUNT. THE FACT THAT FUNDS WERE
MOVING FROM A PROPRIETARY TRADING ACCOUNT TO A THIRD PARTY
BANK ACCOUNT SHOULD HAVE LED RESPONDENT'S EMPLOYEES
EXECUTING THE TRANSACTIONS TO QUESTION CUSTOMER A'S ACTIONS
AND TO INVESTIGATE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ACCOUNT WAS
BEING CARRIED PROPERLY. HOWEVER, RESPONDENT'S EMPLOYEES
FAILED TO DILIGENTLY INVESTIGATE THE SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS.
NO LATER THAN JANUARY 15, 2010, RESPONDENT REALIZED THAT THE
CUSTOMER A'S PROPRIETARY FUTURES TRADING ACCOUNT HAD BEEN
CARRIED IMPROPERLY SINCE 2006. RESPONDENT'S NEW YORK OFFICE
BEGAN ISSUING EMAILS TO RESPONDENT'S OKLAHOMA BRANCH ON
JANUARY 15, 2010, INDICATING THAT CUSTOMER A'S ACCOUNT WOULD
HAVE TO BE CLOSED AND A NEW ACCOUNT IN THE UNDERLYING THIRD
PARTY CLIENT'S NAME OPENED. NONETHELESS, RESPONDENT'S
OKLAHOMA BRANCH CONTINUED TO ALLOW TRADING ON BEHALF OF THE
THIRD PARTY CLIENT TO TAKE PLACE IN CUSTOMER A'S ACCOUNT IN
JANUARY 2010, MARCH 2010, AND MAY 2010. THE THIRD PARTY CLIENT'S
FUNDS WERE ULTIMATELY MOVED FROM CUSTOMER A'S PROPRIETARY
ACCOUNT TO AN ACCOUNT IN THE THIRD PARTY CLIENT'S NAME ON OR
ABOUT MAY 27, 2010.
AT THE TIME OF THE EVENTS, RESPONDENT MAINTAINED AN INADEQUATE
SYSTEM OF SUPERVISION AND INTERNAL CONTROLS TO DETECT AND

FINRA RULE 2010, NASD RULE 3010 - A JUNIOR TRADER AT MORGAN
STANLEY SMITH BARNEY LLC ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRADING
FEDERAL AGENCY PRODUCTS (FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC) IN A CASH
BOOK AND FUTURES CONTRACTS (EURODOLLAR AND TREASURIES) IN A
FUTURES BOOK. THE JUNIOR TRADER WAS PERMITTED TO TRADE
REMOTELY SO HE COULD TRADE AFTER HOURS AND REACT TO EVENTS
OCCURRING GLOBALLY. AT THE END OF ONE TRADING DAY, THE TRADER
HAD ACCUMULATED A FUTURES POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY $744
MILLION, OVER DOUBLE THE AGENCY DESK'S LIMIT OF $350 MILLION AND
SEVERAL MULTIPLES OVER HIS POSITION LIMIT OF $116 MILLION. THAT
EVENING HE TRADED AT HOME AND OVERNIGHT SO THAT BY THE
FOLLOWING MORNING HE HAD FURTHER EXCEEDED HIS POSITION LIMIT
WITH HOLDINGS IN EURODOLLAR AND TREASURY FUTURES OF $1.33
BILLION. THE MARKET TURNED AGAINST HIM AND HE ATTEMPTED
UNSUCCESSFULLY TO REDUCE HIS EXPOSURE AND SUFFERED LOSSES.
THAT MORNING THE FIRM IDENTIFIED ON A T+1 BASIS A RISK ANOMALY
WHICH WAS TRACED TO THE TRADER AND CUT OFF HIS ACCESS TO THE
TRADING SYSTEM. THE TRADER HAD REDUCED THE CUMULATIVE
POSITION TO $740 MILLION BUT THE FIVE-YEAR AGENCY BOOK
SUSTAINED A REALIZED LOSS OF $4.7 MILLION. THE FIRM LIQUIDATED 75%
OF THE REMAINING CONTRACTS AND LIQUIDATED THE REST THE
FOLLOWING DAY, THEREBY REALIZING ADDITIONAL LOSSES. BASED ON
THE TRADER'S TRADING OVER TWO DAYS, THE FIRM'S ACCOUNT
SUSTAINED REALIZED LOSSES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $14.9 MILLION.
SINCE THESE WERE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS, THERE WAS NO
CUSTOMER LOSS. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS OR
CONTROLS IN PLACE TO DETECT THAT THE TRADER HAD EXCEEDED HIS
POSITION LIMIT BY THE END OF THE TRADING DAY OR TO PREVENT HIM
FROM EXCEEDING HIS POSITION LIMIT WHILE TRADING REMOTELY
OVERNIGHT. THE TRADING DESK DID NOT HAVE A CONSOLIDATED VIEW
TO CAPTURE AND MONITOR TRADING ACTIVITY ACROSS PRODUCTS AND
SYSTEMS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO DETECT THAT
THE TRADER HAD EXCEEDED THE AGENCY'S DESK AND HIS OWN
POSITION LIMIT. THE FIRM ALSO DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CONTROLS TO
PREVENT THE TRADER FROM EXCEEDING HIS POSITION LIMIT WHILE
TRADING REMOTELY OVERNIGHT.
